            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stocks continued a torrid march higher, inspired by early earnings results and un-fazed by threats of government shutdown. Temporary government funding is set to run out of money tonight (Friday), though lawmakers remained optimistic about reaching an agreement to extend it. All of the major equity market trends from 2017 were followed – international stocks modestly outperformed, small cap lagged, technology led, and utilities lagged. Apple announced it would repatriate the vast majority of its $252 billion overseas cash hoard and pay $38 billion in taxes – a victory for President Trump. GE fell 10% on more bad news related to its legacy insurance division. </p>
                <h2>Weekly Returns:</h2>
                <p>S&#038;P 500: 2,810 (+0.9%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+1.0%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.66% (+0.11%)<br />
                Gold: $1,332 (-0.5%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.222 (+0.2%)</p>
                <h2>Major Events:</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Tuesday – GE said it would take a $6 billion charge and set aside $15 billion in reserves related to its GE Capital unit. The CEO said he was open to breaking apart the company.</li>
                <li>Tuesday – Celgene was said to be in talks to acquire Juno Therapeutics.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – Bitcoin briefly dropped below $10,000.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – Apple said it would make a one-time $38 billion tax payment to repatriate overseas cash.
                <li>Thursday – IBM reported revenue growth for the first time since 2012.</li>
                <li>Thursday – Home Security Company ADT priced below expectations in its IPO.</li>
                <li>Friday – Chuck Schumer said he made progress in talks with President Trump on avoiding a government shutdown, but differences remain.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Take:</h2>
                <p>I’m writing this on the afternoon of Friday the 19th. Unless something is done, temporary government funding will run out tonight and parts of government shutdown will begin. Most likely, by the time you read this, another temporary solution will be agreed upon. The market certainly seems to think so – stocks were up and rallied into the close. But it isn’t guaranteed.</p>
                <p>It wasn’t long ago that fears of government shutdown would rattle the markets at least a little. These days it feels like nothing can shake confidence. The biggest drop for all of 2017 was 3%. We view this as a double edged sword. To the extent that investors have learned that trying to time short-term corrections is generally a sucker’s game – it is a good thing. However, if investors have become so sanguine that they no longer expect any volatility and are underestimating the risk level in their portfolio or the amount of risk tolerance they have – that is a bad thing. For now, the party rages on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s a new year, so it’s time to consider boosting contributions to your employer-sponsored retirement savings plan—and the federal government is willing to help (a little.) The maximum contribution has increased this year, so you can shelter a bit more money from taxation, if you choose, to maximize your retirement savings. </p>
                <p>For most workers, the 401k is their standard employer-sponsored retirement plan. Some workers, however, are enrolled in 403b or 457b plans, instead. While there are some minor differences between these plans, they are generally treated in a similar manner, and they usually have the same maximum contribution limits. The main difference between these plans is worker classification. Generally, 401k plans are used by for-profit businesses; 403b plans are used by tax-exempt groups, such as schools or hospitals; and 457b plans are for government workers, although there are some non-governmental organizations that also qualify to use these plans.</p>
                <p>For simplification purposes, this discussion will refer to the most common plan, the 401k. The information is still relevant, though, if you are enrolled in either a 403b or 457b plan.</p>
                <h2>What are the new maximum contributions?</h2>
                <p>According to the IRS, If you are under age 50, your maximum 401k contribution is $18,500 in 2018, which is an increase of $500 over 2017 limits. For workers 50 and over, the catch-up contribution of $6,000 remains constant, which means you can contribute a total of $24,500 in 2018.</p>
                <p>These amounts do not include any contributions from your employer. If you include all possible contributions from your employer, the total maximum amount you can shelter in your employer-sponsored tax-deferred plan in 2018 is $55,000 for those under 50 and $61,000 for those 50 and over. </p>
                <p>If you are enrolled in a 403b and 457b plan, there are some minor differences in the “catchup provisions” in these plans. You should check with your plan administrator to learn about the specific provisions of your plan.</p>
                <p>As you can see, investing in your 401k, 403b or 457b is a valuable, easy way to reduce your taxable income, while building your future retirement funds.</p>
                <h2>But do those numbers sound daunting?</h2>
                <p>It’s nice that workers can put away relatively hefty sums of tax-deferred money each year, which is earmarked for their future selves. But not everyone is worried about maximum contribution levels. Some people are more worried about saving anything at all, or scraping together enough to capture their entire employer match. If that sounds more like you, it’s still a good time to take a fresh look at your contributions to an employer-sponsored retirement plan.</p>
                <p>Some of the best advice you can embrace for your future financial self is to save as much as you can and start as soon as you can. Your employer-sponsored retirement plan is a natural starting point. It is particularly important to try to qualify for all matching contributions, which essentially creates an instant return on your investment. </p>
                <p>If you have trouble saving, look for ways to decrease your monthly expenses and make saving a priority. If you’re not feeling the pinch at least a little each month, you could probably save more—and you probably should. Your retirement account will play a major role in the financial security of your future self. Saving now can help make that account turn into a worthy safety net and give you some financial peace of mind.</p>
                <h2>Second 2018 bonus for savers: Recent tax changes</h2>
                <p>If you have diligently saved money in a tax-deferred account, pat yourself on the back. The 2018 tax reform bill is giving you a little bonus—in addition to higher maximum contribution limits. Tax reform put many workers into a little bit of a lower tax bracket, which means the money you’ve already socked away escaped being taxed at the previously higher rates. For those that begin retirement distributions this year, they will likely be taxed at the new lower rate.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/market-news/q4-2017-market-recap/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">We covered some of the key events that happened in 2017</a>. Now let’s take a look into what that means for 2018. </p>
                <h2>The Bull Market</h2>
                <p>Currently, we’re enjoying the second-longest bull market of the last 100 years. We’re not sure how long this will last, and that makes some folks understandably nervous. But one important thing to remember is this: bull markets don’t die simply from old age. </p>
                <p>Valuations are above historical averages, but this doesn’t mean they’re particularly concerning. Why? Because of tax cuts and interest rates. With tax cuts boosting earnings for most companies (though not yet fully reflected in analyst projections), valuations are not especially frightening. </p>
                <p>Also of concern to some is a flattish yield curve, which historically have been precursors for recessions and declining stock prices (i.e. flat or inverted yield curves). Longer-term rates remain stubbornly low. But today, low corporate bond yields are providing cheap financing for most publicly traded companies. </p>
                <p>We don’t see signs of economic slowdown or anything that may impact the availability of credit/liquidity, which typically are the enders of bull markets. </p>
                <h2>Shrinking Supply</h2>
                <p>Stock prices are a function of supply and demand, and supply is shrinking, with the number of public companies shrinking by more than half in the last 20 years, and total shares outstanding on the S&#038;P 500 falling about 22 billion since 2011, according to Yardeni Research. </p>
                <p>So as the money pouring into stock funds are sourced from things like 401k and pension fund contributions, or bonuses getting invested, it is spread among fewer stocks and fewer shares, making those shares more valuable. While it’s impossible to know this trend’s full impact or how long stocks will benefit, a reduced supply could be a powerful bullish force.  </p>
                <h2>Global Outlook</h2>
                <p>U.S. stocks have dominated their international counterparts in this bull market, which resulted in higher valuations. The forward PE of the MSCI US Index is 19, while the forward-looking PE of the rest of the world is 16, according to MSCI, and on an even playing field, that makes international stocks more attractive looking ahead. As always, we strongly believe a strategic allocation to each, and a disciplined approach to rebalancing, gives the best chance for long-term success. </p>
                <h2>Sector Bets Are Getting Bigger (Again)</h2>
                <p>Most bull markets are headlined by a specific sector. This year, Technology is again rallying and gobbling up share of the market in the process, now representing 24% of the S&#038;P 500. If you are an index investor, you should probably take notice, since this may be a bigger bet than what you realize or want especially if you also own individual stock positions in favorites like Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon or Netflix. Chinese technology stocks have experienced a rapid rise, so a similar issue exists in many international stock index funds.  </p>
                <p>We are not bearish on Technology stocks, or growth stocks in general. The recent rally and valuations are nowhere as extreme as we saw in the late 1990s and it is entirely likely to continue for another year or more. But we do think it is increasingly important that investors are aware of their exposures. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>2017 was a year full of headlines: the second-longest bull market of the last 100 years; a new Fed Chairman in Q4; Bitcoin and cryptocurrency; sweeping tax reform…</p>
                <p>What did this mean for all of us?</p>
                <h2>The S&#038;P 500</h2>
                <p>When it came to the markets, the S&#038;P 500’s 22% return ranked 30th best since 1926, but the tranquility was remarkable with it moving by more than 1% on just eight days (vs. 27% of all days in the last decade). </p>
                <p>Despite initial concerns about high PEs, the impact of rising interest rates on stocks, and uncertainty around the new administration, the S&#038;P 500 rose 22%, producing an unprecedented positive total return every single month of the year. International stocks outperformed the United States and bonds; real estate, and commodities were all positive. </p>
                <h2>Tax Reform</h2>
                <p>Gains throughout the year (especially in the final quarter) were helped by two magic words: “tax reform.” The new legislation slashes corporate tax rates, directly translating into higher income for most companies. While this allows for greater dividends, more share buybacks, and lower price-to-earnings ratios, the somewhat muted reaction upon the passage suggests most of the benefit is priced in. </p>
                <h2>A Look Forward</h2>
                <p>The new year is bringing higher valuations, political uncertainty, and – most likely – rising interest rates. But investors, bolstered by 2017’s consistent gains, seem to be much more optimistic than they were at this time a year ago. What does this mean? It again reflects the emotional challenges of investing in the market. Here’s where having a strategic investment plan that fits your unique needs can be beneficial to reaching your long-term goals.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>We’ve said it before, and we’ll continue saying it: in our view, a good plan includes a diversified approach. While U.S. growth stocks have dominated this long bull market &#8211; which made owning anything else feel somewhat disappointing – one of the most common paths to failure is chasing what has done best in the past. Markets go up and down. Different segments come in and out of favor. </p>
                <p>Our expectations are that those investors who stay diversified will likely end up with more money over time, and those who rebalance along the way should fare better still.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global stocks continued their upward march, ending the week at healthy gains. They paused only briefly Wednesday, which so far has been the only down day in 2018. Much like last year, foreign stocks maintain the lead over domestic, but both are up 4% or more for the first two weeks of the year. Commodities jumped on rebounding oil prices, with gold also ending in positive territory. Bonds moved slightly lower as Treasury yields increased. </p>
                <h2>Weekly Returns:</h2>
                <p>S&#038;P 500: 2,786 (+1.6)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+1.3%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.55% (+0.07%)<br />
                Gold: $1,339 (+1.3%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.220 (+1.4%)</p>
                <h2>Major Events:</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Monday – GoPro announced it will cut 20% of its workforce and exit the drone market, with the CEO stating they would consider a sale to a larger company.</li>
                <li>Tuesday – Eastman Kodak announced it will launch an initial coin offering called KodakCoin, sending shares sharply higher for the day.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – Government officials in China recommended the country slow or halt its purchase of US Treasuries, although no action has been taken at this point.</li>
                <li>Thursday – Dropbox filed to go public, three years after the company received a $10 billion private valuation.</li>
                <li>Thursday – South Korea announced it is preparing a bill to ban trading of cryptocurrencies, sending Bitcoin prices down 13.7% for the day.</li>
                <li>Friday – The Trump administration extended sanctions relief to Iran for another few months as it attempts to modify the 2015 nuclear agreement.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Take:</h2>
                <p>And just like that, 2018 is off to a rip-roaring start. Technology stocks continue to fly high while cryptocurrencies remain in an ongoing state of frenzy. Most of this is highlighted in our Q4 2017 Market Review &#038; Outlook (coming soon!), which also details increasingly optimistic investor sentiment, potentially turning it into a bearish indicator. This year’s shotgun start has only reinforced that opinion. </p>
                <p>Frothiness seems to be growing, and nowhere is that more evident than cryptocurrencies. It’s usually a red flag when everyone you know is trying to strike it rich through the same investment. We saw it in the late ‘90s with Internet stocks, and again in 2007 when people with no real estate backgrounds were suddenly amassing small rental empires. The same is happening with cryptocurrencies, where even the mention of the term “blockchain” can send a stock soaring. Just this week Eastman Kodak announced it will launch KodakCoin in order to help photographers better control photo rights. The stock jumped 120% on the news, and another 57% the following day. It then dropped 21% on Thursday after South Korea announced it will crackdown on digital currencies. This is nuts. </p>
                <p>Elsewhere, the Wall Street Journal pointed to a couple surveys indicating growing bullishness in the market. One of them even showed the strongest amount of bullishness since 1987. You’ve probably heard the term “the market likes to climb a wall of worry.” This means stocks usually rise when there is still a healthy amount of fear and skepticism in the market. The opposite is true when investors become overly optimistic and euphoric. </p>
                <p>We’re not saying we’ve reached a point of euphoria—there are still a lot of strong fundamental drivers out there. But sentiment is creeping into the “highly positive” side of the spectrum. It’s an indicator that’s certainly worth watching. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Investors have enjoyed juicy equity returns for the past several years. Now there is evidence that many investors have become accustomed to the higher market returns and are projecting more of the same for their future.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/en-us/newsroom/press-releases/article/corporate-one/press-releases/dc-pulse-2017_US" rel="noopener" target="_blank">According to a BlackRock survey</a> of retirement plan participants, “66% of surveyed workers believe that over the next decade, returns on their savings will continue to be in line with what they have experienced in the past…while 17% believe they will experience even higher returns.”</p>
                <p>Given that most of these investors have experienced bull-market returns for the past nine years, believing that future returns will remain even or climb higher requires some serious optimism.<br />
                Now, there is nothing inherently wrong with a little wild-eyed optimism. Unfortunately, in the real world misplaced optimism can result in self-delusion—which can be a dangerous thing for investors.</p>
                <h2>How Optimism Can Be Dangerous</h2>
                <p>One danger of being overly optimistic is the risk of believing current market returns will continue or even accelerate, and then making contribution decisions that will result in a financial shortfall. Building a robust investment portfolio is a tough task. Ideally, you need to begin saving early and continue saving for several decades, which takes discipline and determination. But some investors may skip some contributions in favor of vacation or a new car because they have an overly optimistic view of expected market returns.</p>
                <p>A second danger is failing to account for risk tolerance. Few long-term investors are willing to put all their money into high-flying stocks. If you are a cautious investor, but your financial future depends on an unrealistic view of investment returns, you may be in for a dose of tough reality. A portfolio that is structured to account for your risk tolerance level will likely never match pure equity returns. Prudent investors—and certainly cautious ones—build well diversified investment portfolios that include a variety of assets, such as bonds and other asset classes, in addition to equities. As a result, they give up some return in order to reduce potential downside risk.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>If you think you tend to overestimate expected portfolio returns, seeking out a professional advisor may help you avoid a potentially dangerous thought pattern. An advisor will typically look at your historical data, asset allocation, risk tolerance, and your contributions to help you understand what future returns may look like.</p>
                <p>While no one can predict long-term returns, trusted financial advisors strive to implement disciplined strategies based upon an individual’s financial picture, goals, and risk tolerance; rather than making decisions based upon emotions.  If you accept a more realistic assessment of long-term returns, you will be less inclined to skip contributions—and you might even increase them. </p>
                <p>Understanding how your portfolio is expected to behave based on its risk level often leads to better long-term planning.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The beginning of a new year is a good time to plan charitable giving strategies for the upcoming year. Taking the time to do this kind of legacy planning now can maximize not only the impact of your charitable gifts, but also the tax benefits you may receive from making these gifts.</p>
                <p>A unique giving opportunity exists for couples and individuals who are 70½ years of age or over. By utilizing what’s known as a Qualified Charitable Distribution (or QCD), you can meet the requirement to take minimum distributions from your IRA and help support charitable causes you believe in at the same time.</p>
                <h2>How QCDs Can Help with RMDs</h2>
                <p>Once you reach age 70½, the IRS necessitates taking required minimum distributions (RMDs) from your IRA regardless of whether you need the money or not. Since IRAs are tax-advantaged retirement accounts, the government won’t let you keep the money in them forever. </p>
                <p>When you start taking IRA distributions, you’ll have to pay taxes on the withdrawals at ordinary income tax rates. This can result in extra taxes that can put a crimp in your retirement finances.</p>
                <p>This is where QCDs come into play. Using these, you can distribute up to $100,000 directly from your IRA to a qualified charity. When given this way, IRA distributions are not considered taxable income to you, which means you don’t have to pay income tax on the distributions, yet the donation still helps to satisfy the requirement for a minimum distribution.</p>
                <h2>QCDs are Now Permanent</h2>
                <p>QCDs were first introduced temporarily in 2006. Until recently, the rule allowing QCDs had to be renewed by Congress every year, which obviously resulted in a certain amount of uncertainty around this particular planning topic. </p>
                <p>This uncertainty changed with the passage of the Protecting Americans from Tax Hikes (PATH) Act in 2015, which finally made QCDs permanent. As a result, these days you can incorporate QCDs into your charitable giving and tax strategies each year(unless the rules change, that is!).</p>
                <h2>More QCD Benefits</h2>
                <p>There are several other potential benefits to using QCDs in addition to relieving the tax burden posed by having to take RMDs, including the following:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Initiating a QCD from an IRA does not impact your adjusted gross income (AGI). A number of different phase-outs for certain taxes and tax breaks are based on AGI — such as those for itemized deductions, the net investment income tax, Roth IRA contribution eligibility and certain exemptions — so this is an important consideration.</li>
                <li>You can bypass the rule that restricts charitable giving to a percentage of your AGI. Distributing money directly from your IRA to a charity using a QCD effectively reduces your AGI even if your contribution would have exceed the percentage limit of AGI. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>QCD Criteria</h2>
                <p>There are several important criteria that must be met to initiate a QCD. For example, you must be at least 70½ years old by the end of the year when the distribution is made. Also, the distribution must be made from a traditional, rollover or inherited IRA — it cannot be made from a SIMPLE or SEP IRA.</p>
                <p>Perhaps most importantly, the QCD funds must be distributed directly from the IRA to the charity itself. Practically speaking, this means the check should be made out to the charity, not to you personally. Take note: If it’s made out to you, the distribution will be a taxable event and you’ll lose the benefits of using a QCD.</p>
                <p>Also make sure that the organization you’re giving the money to is a qualified public charity, or in IRS parlance, a 501(c)(3) organization. It’s also advisable to get a confirmation letter from the charity stating you didn’t receive anything of value in exchange for your gift.</p>
                <p>To initiate a QCD, simply submit a distribution form to the IRA custodian requesting that the check be made out directly to your desired charity. The check can be sent straight to the charity or to you if you prefer to deliver it to the charity yourself.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>As you plan your charitable giving and tax strategies for 2018, think about whether utilizing a Qualified Charitable Distribution might be a wise move. And be sure to speak with a financial advisor and tax professional about your specific tax and financial situation in more detail.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stocks picked up in 2018 right where they left off last year. Global equity indexes were higher in all four trading days, international outpaced the US, technology and high momentum stocks led and small caps lagged. Two major milestones were reached as the Nasdaq topped 7,000 and the Dow topped 25,000. Friday’s jobs report fell short of expectations, but solid wage gains were viewed positively. Analysts raised earnings expectations and now forecast 15% growth for the S&#038;P 500 in 2018.</p>
                <h2>Weekly Returns:</h2>
                <p>S&#038;P 500: 2,674 (+2.6%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+3.2%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.48% (+0.07%)<br />
                Gold: $1,320 (+1.3%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.203 (+0.3%)</p>
                <h2>Major Events:</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Tuesday – Global sales of passenger cars and trucks likely passed the 90 million mark for the first time in 2017.</li>
                <li>Tuesday – The Nasdaq passed 7,000 on the first day of trading, fueled by tech stocks.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – Dominion Energy agreed to buy troubled Scana for roughly $7.3 billion.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – Brazilian oil company Petrobras agreed to pay $2.95 billion to resolve a class action suit by investors related to its corruption issues.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – The tech world looked for ways to address two security flaws revealed in Intel chips.</li>
                <li>Thursday – Sears announced it will close an additional 100 Kmart and Sears stores.</li>
                <li>Thursday – Quicksilver agreed to buy rival Billabong for about $315 million.</li>
                <li>Thursday – The Dow closed above 25,000 for the first time.</li>
                <li>Friday – Non-farm payrolls rose by 148,000 in December, less than expected, but capped a strong 2017 and extended a record streak of 87 consecutive months of gains. The official unemployment rate remained at 4.1%.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our take:</h2>
                <p>On the first trading day of the year, the Nasdaq passed the 7,000 milestone. According to the Wall Street Journal, nearly 70% of the 1,000 points gained since 6,000 came from Facebook, Apple, Amazon, Microsoft and Google. The 1,000-point gain was the third fastest ever, trailing only two instances in 1999 and 2000 just before the dot-com bust (though it is worth noting 1,000 points now is a smaller percentage). </p>
                <p>Tech stock prices are being driven by a combination of rapidly rising earnings and expanding valuations, meaning investors are expecting more growth and are willing to pay more for each dollar of earnings. That combination can work as long as earnings keep, in fact, growing. Profit margins for corporate America are near all-time highs. One reason for that is dominance of the big consumer facing technology companies in their segments. It isn’t fair to call any of the stocks mentioned above monopolies, but they have some monopolistic characteristics. Ultimately, profits can only represent so much of GDP before the concept of capitalism and competition are deemed broken or there is populist revolt. It is hard to see the growth trends reversing in 2018, so that could be a ways off, but we suspect the next leg up in corporate earnings may be tougher to climb. </p>
                <p>The parallels to 1999 keep becoming stronger. Things are nowhere near as extreme or frothy as they were then, and supply of stocks is shrinking instead of growing (which is a bullish factor), but we suggest investors be cautious when they start feeling “it is different this time”.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>Your relationship with money can blossom with just a few changes.</h3>
                <p>Is your relationship with money a little rocky? Maybe you spend too much, save too little or just totally ignore the whole situation. If so, make 2018 your year to improve your relationship and begin using your money more wisely.</p>
                <p>How do you assess the current state of your relationship with money? </p>
                <p>Ask yourself one simple question about your daily life: <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Do you know how much you spend each month?</a> If your answer is everything you can find—including the loose change in your car—your money relationship likely needs a major adjustment. If your answer is less extreme, but you know you could use some help, our simple tips may also apply to you.</p>
                <p>Many people ignore their finances because they don’t know how to begin to take control of them, but it’s surprisingly easy once you make a plan and stick to it. These five simple tips will help you change your relationship with money and develop a more financially secure life.</p>
                <h2>1. Build an emergency fund</h2>
                <p>The most important first step is to build an emergency fund, which can help you pay for unexpected expenses, such as car repairs, or help you endure a job loss or other financial catastrophe. If you don’t have an emergency fund, you may be forced to rely on credit cards or other debt, which can turn your temporary emergency into a much longer-term setback. </p>
                <p>Most experts say your emergency fund should cover three to six months of expenses. While six months is obviously best for everyone, single people or two-income families may be able to get by with less, while most single-income families should try to put a full six months in reserve. The amount necessary to set aside is dependent on your personal finances. While the default is generally six months, single people or dual income families may be able to get by with less. However most single-income families should try to put a full six months in reserve. </p>
                <h2>2. Establish goals</h2>
                <p>The second step is to understand what you want your money to do and what it will take to make that happen. For example, do you have a retirement age in mind? Are you saving to buy a house? Do you want to go into business for yourself? If so, are you actively pursuing these goals? Many people do not look beyond their short-term financial needs, so they never give themselves a chance to build the financially secure future they truly want. </p>
                <h2>3. Assess your situation</h2>
                <p>Now that you have established your goals, you can assess your current situation more effectively. Keeping your goals firmly in mind, what changes do you need to make to ensure your success? You’ll probably be working on several goals simultaneously, depending on your specific situation. For example, <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/retirement-planner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">retirement is a goal</a> that nearly everyone will always be working on simultaneously because of its long-term nature. Don’t let more short-term goals, such as buying a house or a car, overshadow this very important long-term goal. Allocate appropriately to fund each of your important goals.</p>
                <h2>4. Track your current circumstances</h2>
                <p>Know what you are saving versus what you are spending. If you have too much debt, you may need to reduce it and stop unnecessarily using debt in the future. If your monthly living expenses are too high, you may need to look at new options. Can you downsize? Move to a less expensive area? Cut your commuting costs? Once you’ve made necessary spending adjustments, pay yourself first. That’s right, you owe it to yourself to make your goals your ultimate priority. Determine how much you can (and need to) save each month, and write yourself a check before any other expenses. If you don’t, your savings account will probably be filled with nothing more than good intentions—and your goals will never be met.</p>
                <h2>5. Invest</h2>
                <p>Your goals cannot be met by merely collecting interest on the money you have in savings. Retirement, alone, is a big goal that requires a judicious investment strategy. Start with your employer’s retirement plan. If you have access to a 401k or similar plan, maximize your contributions. This is particularly important if your employer matches all or part of that contribution. Workers who don’t contribute at least enough to qualify for an employer’s match are just throwing away part of their annual salary and benefits package. </p>
                <p>If you don’t have access to a retirement plan through your employer, you can start an IRA account on your own. Once you have an account, you need an investment strategy that matches your tolerance for risk &#8211;  which can be governed through diversification &#8211; and your investment timeline. You may have different strategies for different goals, but you should always track your risk and keep overall costs to a minimum.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>With smart spending, consistent saving and effective investing, you can achieve your financial goals—and these five tips will help you begin. If you need help with some of the details, a skilled advisor can assist with your needs. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The new tax act, which was signed into law by President Trump on December 22, is the most comprehensive reform of the U.S. tax code in more than 30 years. The passage of the tax reform act will have a significant impact on the tax strategies of many Americans in 2018 and beyond.</p>
                <p>Here are some of the ways that tax reform could affect tax planning for you and your family.</p>
                <h2>Standard Deduction Raised</h2>
                <p>To itemize or not? This is the big question many individuals and families will be facing now that the <a href="https://www.forbes.com/forbes/welcome/?toURL=https://www.forbes.com/sites/kellyphillipserb/2017/12/20/what-your-itemized-deductions-on-schedule-a-will-look-like-after-tax-reform/&#038;refURL=&#038;referrer=#611567976334" rel="noopener" target="_blank">standard deduction has been drastically increased</a> — from $13,000 to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly, from $9,350 to $18,000 for heads of household, and from $6,500 to $12,000 for singles.</p>
                <p>With a higher standard deduction, it may no longer make sense to go to the trouble of itemizing deductions for things like charitable contributions, home mortgage interest or state and local taxes. If the standard deduction is higher than the total of your itemized deductions, you will likely be better off just claiming the standard deduction. Not only could this save you tax dollars, but it will also simplify tax preparation.</p>
                <h2>Some Itemized Deductions Limited</h2>
                <p>Speaking of itemized deductions, some of the <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/20/here-are-the-finalize.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most popular deductions </a>have been limited by tax reform. These include a $10,000 limit on deductions for state and local taxes you pay and a limit on deducting mortgage interest to the interest paid on new loans up to $750,000, down from $1 million before tax reform. </p>
                <p>Due to all of these factors, there’s a chance that it might not be as beneficial for you to itemize deductions going forward as it has been in the past. You’ll need to crunch the numbers to determine the best strategy for yourself and your family.</p>
                <h2>Section 529 Plans Expanded</h2>
                <p>Section 529 plans have become a popular way for many families to save money for their children’s college educations. Thanks to tax reform, you can now use money you’ve saved in a 529 plan not only for college expenses, but also for private K-12 education expenses (<a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/29/tax-bill-529-plan-provision-helps-families-save-on-school-costs-taxes.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">up to $10,000</a>).</p>
                <p>Additionally, education-related tax breaks like the American Opportunity and Lifetime Learning tax credits — which are worth up to $2,500 and $2,000 per qualifying student, respectively — were retained by the tax reform act, so you can continue to factor these into your education savings plans going forward.</p>
                <h2>Estate Tax Exemption Doubled</h2>
                <p><a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ashleaebeling/2017/12/21/final-tax-bill-includes-huge-estate-tax-win-for-the-rich-the-22-4-million-exemption/#1e9a15041d54" rel="noopener" target="_blank">The tax reform act doubled the estate tax exemption</a> from $5.6 million per person ($11.2 million per couple) to $11.2 million per person ($22.4 million per couple). This means that the 40% tax on assets transferred to heirs upon death will now only apply to estates that are larger than these exemption limits.</p>
                <p>As a result, it will be easier for wealthy individuals and families to pass their assets on to children and grandchildren without the burden of taxation or the need to utilize complicated and expensive trust arrangements. </p>
                <h2>Capital Gains and Dividends Rates Unchanged</h2>
                <p>The tax law retains the existing long-term capital gains and dividends rates of 0%, 15% and 20%. Therefore, your investment tax strategies may not need to change drastically.</p>
                <p>In 2018, the capital gains and dividend tax brackets are as follows:</p>
                <table style="width:100%">
                <tr>
                <th>Bracket</th>
                <th>Single</th>
                <th>Head of Household</th>
                <th>Married Filing Jointly</th>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>0%</td>
                <td>$0-38,599</td>
                <td>$0-51,699</td>
                <td>$0-77,199</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>15%</td>
                <td>$38,600-424,799</td>
                <td>$51,700-451,399</td>
                <td>$77,200-478,999</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                <td>20%</td>
                <td>$425,800+</td>
                <td>$452,400+</td>
                <td>$479,000+</td>
                </tr>
                </table>
                <h2>AMT Retained, But Exemptions Increased</h2>
                <p>Though earlier drafts of the tax reform bill repealed the individual Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), the final version retained the AMT. But significant increases in the AMT exemptions and income phase-out levels — <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/gop-tax-bill-curbs-impact-of-hated-amt/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">which are rising to $500,000 for individuals and $1 million for married couples</a> filing jointly — will result in far fewer individuals and families having to pay the AMT going forward.</p>
                <h2>Popular Tax Breaks Preserved</h2>
                <p>From a tax planning perspective, it’s also worth noting that the tax reform act preserved the home sale capital gain exclusion of up to $250,000 for individuals and $500,000 for married couples filing jointly. This means you can still potentially shield profits on qualified home sales up to these amounts from federal income tax. </p>
                <p>And the law preserved and even expanded the medical expense itemized deduction. Previously, only medical expenses that exceeded 10% of annual adjusted gross income (AGI) were deductible, but <a href="https://turbotax.intuit.com/tax-tips/health-care/deducting-medical-expenses-for-a-major-illness-or-injury/L5fSkrd6C" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this threshold has been reduced to 7.5%</a> for 2017 and 2018. So if you had major medical expenses last year or will have them this year, you might benefit from this provision.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>This is just a brief discussion of some of the potential impacts of the new tax act. Be sure to consult with a tax professional for more details on how tax reform could affect you and your family.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A selloff in the final trading minutes of the year pushed stocks into the red for the shortened holiday week. Technology stocks lagged for the week, led by Apple after some analysts suggested demand for the iPhone X was lower than expected and there was backlash against throttling performance of older phones. The market’s muted reaction in the first full week of trading after the passage of the tax bill suggests most of the benefits were widely expected and are likely already baked into prices. </p>
                <h2>Weekly Returns:</h2>
                <p>S&#038;P 500: 2,674 (-0.3%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.6%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.41% (-0.07%)<br />
                Gold: $1,303 (+2.2%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.120 (+1.2%)</p>
                <h2>Major Events:</h2>
                <ul>
                <li>Wednesday –JPMorgan Chase agreed to pay $2.8 million to settle charges that it failed to segregate client assets from its own.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – The Wall Street Journal reported many comments posted about the DOL Fiduciary rule were fake. It is unclear who made the posts but most were critical of the rule.</li>
                <li>Thursday – Doug Jones became the first Democrat in 25 years to be confirmed as a Senator of Alabama.</li>
                <li>Friday – President Trump tweeted that the USPS should charge more for delivering packages for Amazon and others.</li>
                <li>Friday – Pershing Square and Valeant agreed to a $290 million settlement regarding improper trading before a 2014 bid for Allergan.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Take:</h2>
                <p>2017 was an interesting year. The news was dominated by disturbing headlines including severe natural disasters, mass shootings, and threats of nuclear war. Meanwhile, a heightened sense of dividedness blanketed the country. Capital markets didn’t care. The S&#038;P 500 rose over 21%, including dividends. While this marks just the 31st best year since 1926, the tranquility was truly special. The S&#038;P 500 moved by more than 1% on just 8 days in 2017, compared to 27% of all days over the last 10 years. There were no 2% moves and the biggest peak to trough decline was just 3%.</p>
                <p>For those invested in a strategic long-term allocation, this was rewarding and stress-free. We don’t see any immediate catalyst for what would cause volatility to rise to more normal levels, but we suggest investors be ready for it to happen eventually. 2017 was also a good year for many stock-pickers. The trendiest names, such as Apple, Amazon, Facebook, Netflix and Tesla were all up around 50%. This makes the new-year a great time to revisit allocations and ensure your strategy fits your long term goals and risk tolerance. Historically, most stock pickers and market timers don’t fare well over full market cycles and sector rotation can happen quickly and intensely. </p>
                <p>We don’t know when this bull will end – there is no reason it has to any time soon. But a repeat of the ease of 2017 is unlikely. For the long weekend ahead, we hope you take a moment to reflect. And if your situation permits, consider using some gains from 2017 to do something memorable with friends or family in 2018. </p>
                <p>From all of us at Personal Capital, we wish you a happy, safe and prosperous new year. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This is the time when many people make resolutions for the upcoming year. Determining to lose weight, eat healthier or exercise more are some of the most common New Year’s resolutions. But last year, financially-related New Year’s resolutions also consistently made it into the top.</p>
                <p>As 2018 approaches, you may be vowing to do better around your physical and financial health. If you fall into the latter camp, here are five ideas to get you started:</p>
                <h2>Manage Your Debt Efficiently</h2>
                <p>Excessive and irresponsible use of debt is one of the biggest hindrances to financial success for many people. Every dollar that goes toward paying down debt is a dollar that can’t be used for more productive financial goals like saving for retirement or college. </p>
                <p>Start by prioritizing so you can focus on paying down debts with the highest interest rates first. For most people, this is credit card debt. If you carry balances on more than one card, focus on paying off one card at a time before moving on to the next one. When you’ve paid off all your credit card debt, move on to other consumer debts like car loans.</p>
                <p>Your goal shouldn’t necessarily be to eliminate debt, but rather to manage your debt efficiently. When used responsibly, debt can be an effective financial tool — deductible home mortgage and home equity line of credit interest is a good example. You might consider restructuring some debt; for example, locking in fixed-rate debt for the long term before interest rates move higher.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/net-worth" rel="noopener" target="_blank">[See a complete picture of your net worth at any time]</a></p>
                <h2>Control Your Spending</h2>
                <p>This goes along with managing your debt. Paying down debt won’t accomplish much if you don’t get a handle on spending — you’ll just find yourself right back where you were in a year or two.</p>
                <p>Controlling spending is often a matter of learning the art of delayed gratification. Instead of using a credit card to buy things you want right now, wait until you’ve saved enough money and then buy them. Many people find that they enjoy their purchases more when they buy them this way because they don’t have the cloud of debt payments hanging over their head.</p>
                <h2>Build a “Rainy Day” Savings Fund</h2>
                <p>Many financial experts recommend accumulating between three and six month’s worth of living expenses in a liquid savings account you can tap for financial emergencies, like an unexpected car repair, major medical expense or job loss. A bank savings or money market account is usually a good vehicle since the money can typically be withdrawn penalty-free and without tax consequences.</p>
                <p>When you have cash set aside for financial emergencies like these, you won’t have to use a credit card to pay for them. This, in turn, will help you as you concentrate on New Year’s resolution number 1 above.</p>
                <h2>Increase Your Retirement Savings</h2>
                <p>The latest statistics regarding retirement savings in the U.S. are pretty bleak. According to the National Institute on Retirement Security, the median retirement account balance for all working-age households in the U.S. is just $3,000. Also, nine out of 10 U.S. households do not meet conservative retirement savings targets for their age and income.</p>
                <p>You can buck these statistical trends by resolving to max out your retirement savings accounts this year. In 2018, you can contribute up to $18,500 to a 401(k), 403(b) or 457 retirement plan, or $24,500 if you’re 50 years of age or over. In addition, you can contribute up to $5,500 to an IRA, or $6,500 if you’re 50 years of age or over. </p>

                <h2>Evaluate Your Asset Allocation and Rebalance Your Portfolio</h2>
                <p>Over time, the mix of asset classes in your investment portfolio can shift as the markets fluctuate. This will affect your asset allocation — or the percentage of your portfolio that consists of stocks, bonds and cash instruments. When this happens, it may be necessary to rebalance your portfolio. </p>
                <p>You can do this by selling some asset classes, such as stocks, and buying others, such as fixed-income instruments. For example, with the stock market performing well over the past year, your portfolio might be over-weighted in equities. If so, you might consider selling some stocks and using the money to buy bonds in order to bring your portfolio back into balance to meet your long-term investing goals.</p>

                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>With the new year approaching quickly, now is a good time to plan your 2018 financial resolutions so you can hit the ground running on January 1. </p>
                <p>Be sure to consult with a financial advisor for more details on these and other financial planning strategies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people view trusts as something only necessary for the ultra-wealthy. But like a good whiskey, trusts don’t need to be just for the upper-income echelons. They can be a good, tax-savvy way to pass your estate on to your heirs, regardless of the size of your assets and family, and can help you manage your property during your life and beyond.</p>
                <h2>What is a Trust?</h2>
                <p>A trust is a legal entity you set up to hold, safeguard, distribute and control those assets you place into the trust. When it comes to managing your trust, there generally is a trustor (a.k.a. the “grantor” or “settlor”) who sets up the trust; the trustee who manages the trust’s properties; the beneficiary who receives the assets of the trust; and the successor trustee (and beneficiary), who takes over if the original trustee is unable to serve.</p>
                <p>A trust carries rules and provisions that you create in order to dictate what happens to the assets held under the ownership of the trust. Because there are various types of trusts, you will want to decide what type meets your objectives the best, and ensure you follow the rules for that trust so that the legal requirements continue to be met.</p>
                <h2>Why Would You Set Up a Trust?</h2>
                <p>There are many reasons to set up a trust. Some – but not all &#8211; of the many benefits can include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Avoiding or reducing estate and gift taxes</li>
                <li>Avoiding or reducing the complex and lengthy probate process</li>
                <li>Protecting your estate’s assets from beneficiaries’ creditors or legal situations</li>
                <li>Donating to charities in tax-efficient manners</li>
                <li>Protecting you and your beneficiary’s privacy (terms of trusts are usually not public, unlike the probate process)</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Who Needs a Trust?</h2>
                <p>While we don’t believe a trust is necessarily exclusive only to high net-worth people, if you have a net worth over $10 million, you will likely want to consider a trust. Also, for those who want to leave property to a beneficiary who is incapable of handling their own finances – through disability or otherwise – trusts can be a valuable tool. Individuals who want to ascertain a certain degree of control of how the assets are utilized or distributed may also want to consider trusts to outright bequests.</p>
                <p>In addition, a trust may be a right vehicle for you if you:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Are middle-aged or older – or in poor health</li>
                <li>Not able to take advantage of simpler probate-avoidance methods</li>
                <li>Own out-of-state real estate</li>
                <li>Are not worried about big creditors’ claims</li>
                <li>Have incapacity concerns.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Of course, this isn’t a final list of reasons to consider a trust, so you’ll want to contact an Estate Attorney to see if a trust is right for you.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>Trusts can be helpful for families of all sizes and incomes, but creating and administering a trust can be (but isn’t always) a complex, time consuming and a relatively expensive process. Deciding whether to set up a trust, the type of trust, and what provisions to include depend on your individual circumstances and goals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Personal Capital uses technology that combines real-time financial account aggregation, investor profile data, and a Monte Carlo projection engine to identify optimal asset allocation. Our innovation raises the bar for the financial advisory industry.</p>
                <p>Two things make this groundbreaking and important for individual investors like you:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>It is truly personalized, based on your actual cash flows. The Monte Carlo engine helps show how much growth you need, and how much risk really makes sense for you.</li>
                <li>The use of account aggregation keeps your plan on track and updated. By having a real-time balance sheet and an easy one-stop place to enter your retirement goals, it is realistic to know when your asset allocation should change.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Asset allocation is one of the most important drivers of investment success, but for most people the process is sloppy and arbitrary. Most “do-it-yourself” investors fall into a random asset allocation based on a collection of historical purchases.</p>
                <p>Target date funds are a crude step in the right direction because they use some actual data (e.g. expected retirement date), but are too generic to be useful. Those who work with advisors are generally asked a handful of questions and then slotted into a model portfolio. Frequently it is based on little more than age and risk tolerance, and it is rarely updated unless someone complains or leaves.</p>
                <p>Using our leading-edge technology, we incorporate these two critical variables (in real-time) in our algorithm:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Required Growth Rate</strong> for individuals who are still working</li>
                <li><strong>Expected Withdrawal Rate</strong> for those in or nearing retirement</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>How it Works</h2>
                <ol>
                <li><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">Our Financial Dashboard</a> tracks what you’ve got and what you owe, and can show you how much you are saving or spending, without any work from you.</li>
                <li>You indicate how much you want to spend each year in retirement. We’ll help figure out how much Social Security you will get, as well as any expected recurring retirement income like pensions or rental income.</li>
                <li>We’ve built a behind-the-scenes Monte Carlo projection engine which calculates:
                <ul>
                <li>How much money you will need to retire and what growth rate you need to achieve it (if you’re still working).</li>
                <li>Your projected withdrawal rate, the percent of your portfolio you will need to spend each year (if you’re retired or close to it).</li>
                </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Our internal algorithm utilizes these critical outputs in conjunction with traditional factors like age, retirement age, risk tolerance, time horizon, legacy wishes, non-liquid asset values, etc., to recommend an optimal asset allocation. For our Wealth Management clients, our Advisors and Investment Committee add an additional layer of human oversight and review.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Our algorithm is designed to balance your need, ability, and willingness to take risk. Unless indicated otherwise, the primary goal is maximizing the portfolio’s odds of providing for stated retirement spending targets (also known as &#8220;not running out of money,&#8221; which from our experience is the most common goal for our clients).</p>
                <p>Knowing required growth rate and/or withdrawal rate is critical. Any algorithm that ignores them isn’t worth much.</p>
                <h2>A Retirement Example</h2>
                <p>Let’s say you’re 40 with a moderate risk tolerance and you want to spend $100,000 per year in retirement. There is a big difference between needing 4% growth and needing 8% up to retirement to be in a position to achieve this. Similarly, if you are 62 and want to spend $100,000 per year, we’ll project your cash flows to see what your average withdrawal rate is.</p>
                <p>If you only need 1.5% of your portfolio in withdrawals, you can afford to be conservative if that suits you, or have the option to be aggressive. Your risk tolerance and desire for growth become more important. But if you need 4% withdrawals, diversification trumps other issues to ensure you don’t run out of money. If you need 6%, growth is critical.</p>
                <p>Yes, this can theoretically be done manually with a collection of account statements and Monte Carlo software. But let’s face it, you probably don’t know exactly what your balance sheet looks like and you aren’t going to do a four hour retirement plan every year. And your broker definitely won’t do it for you. Now you can have a real-time asset allocation custom designed to fit your cash flow needs as quickly as you can log in to our software. And we’ll show you how your current portfolio compares.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>We’re currently responsible for managing investment strategies for thousands of families, and that number is growing every day. That’s why we’re blending cutting edge technology with objective financial advice. We believe this is the best way to empower individuals and their money. With our client-centric business model, Personal Capital is fundamentally altering the traditional financial services landscape.</p>

                <li>Friday –  President Trump signs tax bill into law</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Take:</h2>
                <p>The long anticipated GOP tax bill has finally arrived with the biggest impact being on the headline corporate tax rate dropping to 21% from 35%. This bill will provide a tax cut for the vast majority of families, but high earners in the highest tax states, like California and New York, will be impacted hard. This bill is expected to add to add between $500 billion to $1.5 trillion to the federal debt. Long term, this will shorten the timeline for entitlement programs, like Social Security and Medicare, to be addressed. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>On December 20, Congress passed the new tax plan, the most sweeping reform of our nation’s tax code in more than three decades. This legislation will impact the tax situation of almost every U.S. family, individual and business.</p>
                <p>Following is a recap of the major provisions of the tax reform act as they apply to individuals and businesses.</p>
                <h2>On the Individual Side</h2>
                <p>The good news for individuals is that individual tax rates will drop between 0 and 4 percentage points, depending on the tax bracket. The new tax brackets are 10%, 12%, 22%, 24%, 32%, 35% and 37%. </p>
                <p>More good news: The standard deduction will nearly double to $24,000 for married couples filing jointly, $18,000 for heads of household and $12,000 for singles and married couples filing separately. However, the personal exemption of $4,050 is being repealed.</p>
                <p>It’s expected that significantly increasing the standard deduction will result in fewer people itemizing deductions when they file their tax return, since their total itemized deductions may no longer exceed the standard deduction. This would simplify tax filing for these individuals and families.</p>
                <p>The child tax credit is also being increased from $1,000 to up to $2,000, with $1,400 of this refundable. And the phase-out for claiming the child tax credit is being raised from a starting point of $110,000 to $400,000 for married couples, and from a starting point of $75,000 to $200,000 for non-married households. This will result in more Americans being able to claim the child tax credit.</p>
                <p>Note that these changes will become effective for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017. However, the changes are not permanent — they are only effective through the end of 2025.</p>
                <p>A few more changes for individuals are:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Elimination of the Affordable Care Act’s individual mandate requiring taxpayers to buy a qualifying health plan or pay a penalty, effective beginning after December 31, 2018.</li>
                <li>Reduction of the adjusted gross income (AGI) threshold for deducting medical expenses from 10% to 7.5% for 2017 and 2018.</li>
                <li>Increase of the alternative minimum tax (AMT) exemption to $109,400 for married couples filing jointly, $70,300 for singles and heads of household, and $54,700 for married couples filing separately. This expires in 2025.</li>
                <li>Doubling of the estate tax exemption from $5.6 million to an estimated $11.2 million per person in 2018. ($22.4 million for married couples). This increase in the exemption expires in 2025.</li>
                <li>Allowance of Section 529 plan distributions to pay for qualifying elementary and secondary school expenses. These distributions are limited to $10,000 annually for non-college expenses (public, private or religious elementary or secondary school).</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To help offset the impact of these tax cuts on federal revenue, the tax reform act will eliminate or reduce some deductions that many Americans have claimed on their tax returns. These include deductions for personal casualty and theft losses, interest on home equity loans, moving expenses, and alimony for agreements signed after 2018. </p>
                <p>Also, deductions for state and local taxes will be capped at $10,000, and the mortgage limit for deducting home mortgage interest will be reduced from $1 million to $750,000. All of these changes are effective only through the end of 2025.</p>
                <h2>On the Business Side</h2>
                <p>The centerpiece of the tax reform act on the business side is a permanent reduction of the top corporate income tax rate from 35%, which is one of the highest corporate tax rates in the developed world, to 21%. In fact, the entire graduated corporate tax rate schedule is being replaced with a 21% flat rate.</p>
                <p>The tax reform act also includes a 20% qualified income deduction for owners of certain pass-through business entities like sole proprietorships, partnerships, LLCs and S corporations through 2025. Other beneficial business provisions in the act include the following:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Doubling of bonus depreciation to 100% effective for assets acquired and placed in service between September 27, 2017, and January 1, 2023.</li>
                <li>Doubling of the Section 179 expensing limit to $1 million.</li>
                <li>A new tax credit for employer-paid family and medical leave through 2019.</li>
                <li>Repeal of the 20% corporate AMT.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To help offset the impact of these tax cuts on federal revenue, the tax reform act will eliminate or limit some deductions that many businesses have claimed on their tax returns. These include the Section 199 (or domestic production activities) deduction and deductions for net interest expense in excess of 30% of the business’s adjusted taxable income.</p>
                <p>The tax act also limits deductions for net operating losses, places new limits on deductions for employee fringe benefits and excessive employee compensation, and limits like-kind exchanges to real property that is not held primarily for sale.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>This is just a brief recap of some of the provisions of the new tax reform. Be sure to consult with a tax professional for more details on how the legislation could affect you, your family and your business.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>When you think about investing, what do you use as a reference point? </p>
                <p>Many investors use the Great Recession of 2008 as their reference point due to the financial turmoil it caused and they make future financial decisions based on this perspective. </p>
                <p>Because of this crisis, millions of jobs were lost, the housing market collapsed and trillions in investable assets disappeared. Although the effects from this were felt for many years following, the U.S. economy has largely recovered. The stock market has been on a nine-year bull market run and housing is back (or mostly so) across the country. </p>
                <p>But have you recovered psychologically?</p>
                <p>The psychological effects of the Great Recession will likely last long after the actual economic impact is a distant memory. In fact, you could be impacted by the events of 2008 for the rest of your life—unless you actively work to fix your skewed perspective.</p>
                <p>Why? Because of a little mental hiccup called “anchoring.”</p>
                <h2>Anchoring &#038; Your Financial Behavior</h2>
                <p>Like all humans, you’re prone to thought processes that include some significant weaknesses. One of those weaknesses, which is particularly relevant to investing, is called anchoring. Humans are prone to put too much emphasis on an early piece of information, such as the 2008 financial crisis, and then make all future decisions from that point of reference. </p>
                <p>The Great Depression is an extreme historic example of the lasting impact of anchoring. In many instances, the results of this economic destruction invaded the thoughts and habits of an entire generation—governing important aspects for their lives forever. Many of us can see the results in the lives of grandparents or great grandparents, who “pinched pennies” for a lifetime or never threw anything away because “you never know when you might need it.”</p>
                <p>The Great Recession has a similar anchoring impact on many of today’s investors. During this crisis, some people couldn’t find work, some lost all the equity in their homes (or lost their homes), and others watched their retirement nest eggs wither. No wonder this crisis became the latest generation’s anchoring effect. </p>
                <p>If you use the Great Recession as your anchor point, you may be excessively risk averse and prone to extreme worry about equity markets or other investments. Unfortunately, this anchor point could inadvertently be hindering your ability to adequately build your investment portfolio. </p>
                <h2>What Should You Do?</h2>
                <p>First, recognize anchoring for what it is—a psychological hiccup, not your current reality. Think about this: If you had missed the Great Recession, what point of reference would you use? The seemingly endless bull market? Housing bargains everywhere? With that perspective, you might become a highly aggressive investor willing to take a chance on just about anything—which could also become a problem.</p>
                <p>The key is to remove any emotionally charged baggage, such as an early anchoring event, from your evaluation process. Instead of making investment decisions using a specific reference point—and building in an unwarranted bias—focus on your long-term goals. Then do all you can to improve your chances of investment success using the following criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Determine your optimal financial plan based on your objectives</li>
                <li>Develop an asset allocation guided by your risk tolerance</li>
                <li>Make regular contributions at the highest level you can afford</li>
                <li>Avoid chasing the next random payoff or running from perceived disasters</li>
                <li>Stick with your strategy</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>It may be so 2008 – but the Great Recession could still be influencing how you invest. It’s humbling to think that your thought processes might bias your ability to maximize your investment opportunities, but we all should acknowledge this blind spot to help overcome this bias. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It’s coming up toward the end of the year – a time when many folks consider charitable giving. While giving to charity is a great idea year-round, now’s a great time to think about donating and how it fits into your legacy planning.</p>
                <p>While giving is good for the heart, it can also be good for your financial picture – yet, many donors don’t leverage charitable giving to ensure maximum impact on both the recipient of their generosity and their broader financial strategy. By thinking about charitable giving as a clear component of your financial plan, you may find ways to create a strategy and goals that means you can give more wisely, which doesn’t necessarily mean giving more. </p>
                <h2>Leveraging Charitable Giving for Taxes</h2>
                <p>While very few people likely donate only because of tax benefits, there may be some tax breaks you can reap by giving.*</p>
                <p>For instance, you may be able to deduct up to 30% &#8211; and in some cases, up to 50% &#8211; of your AGI. You will need to itemize your charitable contribution deductions in the year in which you give, regardless of whether your contribution is in cash or other property. You can donate property other than cash to a qualified organization – the IRS generally allows you to deduct the fair market value of that property. And, if estate tax is a concern for you, then you may be able to use charitable giving to reduce the tax liability on what you leave behind.</p>
                <p>Another tax benefit may occur through gifting appreciated securities that you’ve held longer than a year. You may be able to avoid paying capital gains taxes since you can receive a tax deduction based on the security’s fair market value.  You should consult your financial advisor for more information.</p>
                <h2>Gifting in Retirement</h2>
                <p>If you are taking a Required Minimum Distribution (RMD) from an IRA (excepting ongoing SEP or SIMPLE IRAs), then a qualified charitable distribution counts as an otherwise taxable distribution from anyone 70 ½ years old by year’s end and can be excluded from gross income. This means a lower taxable income, which also may reduce the impact to certain tax credits and donations, but while you won’t owe income tax on the distribution, you do not get a deduction.</p>
                <p>There are restrictions that apply to donating from your IRA, so you’ll want to consult a professional for more information.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>There’s a lot to be said for charitable giving, whether it’s now during the season of giving, or continued throughout the year. While most of us don’t give simply for the good of our bank accounts, you should consider that there may be financial benefits and it could make sense to take advantage of them when you are considering charitable planning as part of your legacy plan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stocks rallied early in the week on continued anticipation of corporate tax cuts in the United States. They reversed course Thursday when it appeared Senator Marco Rubio might oppose the bill without an increase in the child tax credit, but hit fresh highs on Friday as lawmakers reconciled most of their differences. Somewhat lost in the noise was another 0.25% rate hike by the Federal Reserve. Most major asset categories outside of commodities also ended the week higher, including foreign equities, bonds, gold, and real estate. </p>

                <li>Monday – Bitcoin futures started trading on a Cboe exchange (officially starting Sunday), with trading being halted twice due to extreme price increases.</li>
                <li>Monday – Comcast announced it is ending its pursuit of assets from 21st Century Fox.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – The U.S. Federal Reserve raised rates for the third time in 2017, while reiterating their expectation of three more hikes in 2018.</li>
                <li>Thursday – The FCC voted to end net-neutrality rules established in 2015 under the Obama administration.</li>
                <li>Thursday – Senator Marco Rubio publicly stated he would oppose the GOP tax bill unless the child tax credit was increased.</li>
                <li>Friday – GOP lawmakers scrambled to put finishing touches on their tax bill.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Take:</h2>
                <p>Congress took center stage this week, where Republicans continued their mad race to reconcile differences and push through tax legislation before the holidays. The news has completely dominated headlines, and even overshadowed the Fed raising rates on Wednesday. The final version of the bill is still up in the air (expected to be released in a matter of hours), but there have been a few notable last-minute changes. </p>
                <p>The first is from the Senate’s bill, which attempted to eliminate the ability to select individual tax lots when selling shares. It would have subjected all share sales to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/investing/tax-reform-fifo-vs-hifo/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">FIFO accounting</a> (first-in-first-out), which means the oldest and often most appreciated shares would have to be sold first. This would have significantly tied investors’ hands and impacted widespread practices such as tax loss harvesting. The good news is, at least at this point, the provision has been scrapped. +1 for investors. </p>
                <p>In an effort to placate high income tax states like California and New York, the new compromised bill has also dropped the top marginal tax rate from 39.6% to 37%, and will now allow up to $10,000 of state and local taxes to be deducted. On the surface this seems appealing, but it will only really benefit the highest earners. The 10K maximum won’t be large enough to outweigh the standard deduction, meaning a large chunk of “upper middle class” earners will still see their tax bill increase. -1 for those in high income tax states.</p>
                <p>Some other last minute changes include bumping the child tax credit to $1,400 from $1,100, and settling on a 21% corporate tax instead of 20% (which would begin the rate cut a year earlier). Of course all of this is still speculation as we await the final version. But overall it appears something will pass soon. As we’ve said in the past, the most impactful piece of this bill is the corporate tax cut, which is likely to provide a boost to economic growth. How long that boost lasts is anyone’s guess. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The financial headlines in recent weeks have been dominated by efforts in Washington to pass a major tax reform bill. But the uncertainty created by the possibility of tax reform need not keep you from implementing year-end tax and other financial strategies that could save you money.</p>
                <p>Here are six year-end planning moves to consider making between now and December 31.</p>
                <h2>1. Implement Income-Shifting Strategies</h2>
                <p>One way to reduce current income taxes is to defer taxable income into next year while accelerating deductible expenses into this year. Doing so will lower your current income, which could lower your tax bill in April. This strategy could be especially relevant this year due to the possibility of lower future tax rates if tax reform becomes law.</p>
                <p>To defer income, you could request that any year-end bonuses be paid in early January instead of late December. And if you’re self-employed, you could hold off on sending December invoices until early January if your cash flow permits.</p>
                <p>To accelerate deductions, consider prepaying 2018 property taxes that will be due early next year. Making contributions to your IRA or 401k is another possible strategy. The IRS gives flexibility to contribute with a deadline of the date you file taxes (April 15, for most people). Keep in mind the traditional IRA contribution limit for 2017 is $5,500 (or $6,500 if you’re 50 years of age or over) while the 401k contribution limit for 2017 is $18,000 (or $24,000 if you’re 50 years of age or over). There are also limitations to deductibility based on your income.</p>
                <p>If you’re planning to fund a child’s college education, contributions to a 529 in some states offer a deduction on your state income taxes. These contributions need to deposited by year end.</p>
                <h2>2. Take Advantage of Tax-Loss Harvesting</h2>
                <p>There may be a silver lining to owning underperforming investment assets. With a strategy referred to as tax-loss harvesting, you can sell these investments before the end of the year to realize losses that can be used to offset up to $3,000 (when married filing jointly; $1,500 is the limit when filing single) in taxable investment gains and ordinary income. Unused investment losses above $3,000 may be carried forward to offset future capital gains or income, known as “Carry Forward Losses.”</p>
                <p>If you implement this strategy, watch out for what’s referred to as the wash-sale rule. This prohibits you from buying back the security you sold — or any security that’s substantially equal to it — within 30 days.</p>
                <p><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/financial-planning-2/personal-capital-tax-series-7-the-capital-gains-tax/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">[Learn more about tax loss harvesting here]</a></p>
                <h2>3. Make Tax-Deductible Charitable Contributions</h2>
                <p>At this time of the year, many people desire to help others who are less fortunate. By donating cash or assets to qualified charitable organizations — also known as 501(c)(3) organizations — you may also be able to reduce your taxes.</p>
                <p>Assuming you itemize deductions on your federal income tax return, you can deduct qualifying charitable contributions in the year in which they are made. This includes contributions of cash, investment securities and personal property such as furniture, clothing and vehicles. You can generally deduct up to 50% of your adjusted gross income (AGI) as charitable contributions each year if giving cash, while the deduction is usually capped at 30% when gifting investments.</p>
                <p>If you own appreciated securities, consider gifting them to a qualified charity. Neither you nor the charity will have to pay capital gains tax on the appreciated value. For example, suppose you own a stock that’s currently worth $20,000 and you paid $10,000 for it five years ago. If you donate the stock instead of selling it, you can deduct the full $20,000 value while avoiding paying taxes on $10,000 in capital gains.</p>
                <p>If your income is substantially higher in 2017, then you may want to consider maximizing your charitable deductions for a couple years to come through charitable gift funds. This allows for deductions at a higher bracket.</p>
                <h2>4. Take Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</h2>
                <p>If you own a traditional IRA, SIMPLE IRA, SEP-IRA or 401k account, you can’t keep your money in the account indefinitely. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/rmds-retirement-friend-or-foe/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">You must begin taking RMDs from these types of accounts when you turn age 70½.</a> (Note that RMDs do not apply to Roth IRAs because this money has already been taxed.) RMDs will be counted as taxable income during the year they’re taken.</p>
                <p>For IRAs, the first RMD must be taken by April 1 of the year following the calendar year when you turn 70½. For 401ks, the first RMD must be taken by April 1 following the latter of the calendar year when you turn 70½ or retire. After the first year, you must then take RMDs by December 31 each year.</p>
                <p>Have an Inherited IRA? Many people forget that these are also subject to RMDs even if you’re under the age of 70 ½.</p>
                <h2>5. Rebalance Your Investment Portfolio</h2>
                <p>Thus far, 2017 has been a strong year for the stock market. One result of this could be that your target asset allocation has been knocked out of whack. For example, gains in your stock portfolio could push your percentage of equity holdings higher than your desired balance.</p>
                <p>Therefore, consider meeting with your investment advisor to analyze the current status of your asset allocation. Based on this analysis, you may need to sell securities in some asset classes and buy securities in other asset classes to bring your allocation back to your target balance.</p>
                <h2>6. Spend Down Expiring Benefits</h2>
                <p>Taking advantage of tax –advantaged Flexible Savings Accounts (FSAs) can be a good move to use pre-tax dollars for specific known expenses. One challenge with these accounts is that the funds in them usually expire at the turn of the year. If you have unused funds, you should generally try to use it before losing it!</p>
                <p>In some cases, employers give an elective to extend the benefits until March 15. Before blindly purchasing items, check with your HR team about the extension</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>The end of the year is approaching quickly, so make plans now to determine whether strategies like these could be beneficial for you. And be sure to consult with a tax advisor for more details on the particulars of these and other year-end tax and financial planning strategies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They say only two things are certain in life: death and taxes. Unfortunately, sometimes the two come hand in hand, especially if you haven’t planned ahead. </p>
                <p>Enter taxes – and your estate plan. Currently, the estate tax only impacts those who are leaving behind more than $5.6 million in 2018. This applies to every taxpayer, so conceivably, a married couple can protect $11.2 million from the estate tax.  Because of this, most people aren’t affected by the estate tax &#8211; but those who are impacted can pay at least a 40% rate. One of the main reasons people create a plan that considers taxes is because the taxes your heirs may end up owing on their inheritance can be a significant burden. </p>
                <h2>Planning Ahead to Relieve the Tax Burden</h2>
                <p>Let’s take a quick example: Betsy and Tom own a prosperous farm, and they have four kids. Nearly all of their wealth is tied up in the land they’ve farmed for decades. When they pass away, their four children could be on the hook for the taxes associated with the value of the land – if they don’t plan properly. (Keep in mind, there is an estate tax marital deduction, which allows assets to pass to your spouse without impacting the estate tax exemption, regardless of the size of those assets, so estate taxes usually only come into play after the second spouse passes. At that point, the estate would likely be impacted with a large estate tax.)</p>
                <p>So where will Betsy and Tom’s kids get the money to pay the taxes associated with the estate they will pass on to them? Selling the land can be a slow, costly process and the IRS usually wants its cut of the money in nine months or less. Their kids may not have the capital to pay the taxes out of pocket and trying to sell the farm quickly puts pressure on them to accept an under-market value price for the land </p>
                <p>Betsy and Tom could, however, help their children absorb some of the tax blow by using foresight and some planning. </p>
                <p>How? </p>
                <p>If they plan ahead, Betsy and Tom can use life insurance policies to help cover the impact of estate taxes. They can also set up a life insurance trust to be the beneficiary of the policy so that the death benefits won’t be taxed as part of the estate. Both methods help alleviate any kind of tax burden their beneficiaries may be facing in the event they stand to inherit a large estate. (If you use this approach, you will want to know the specific state laws where you live, since some have estate tax provisions that kick in much earlier.)</p>
                <h2>Estate Taxes &#038; Gift Tax</h2>
                <p>If you find yourself in a position like Betsy and Tom, there are other ways you may be able to help alleviate the tax burden on your beneficiaries. At the federal level, estate taxes can be intertwined with the gift tax. The latter tax applies to assets transferred to others during your lifetime. Typically any gift above $15,000 (for 2018) begins to count against the gifting individual’s lifetime estate tax exemption of $5.6 million. </p>
                <p>This year (2018), the gift tax exclusion allows you to give up to $15,000 per year to any one, to as many people as you’d like. Your spouse can also use this exclusion, and these gifts don’t count against the lifetime gift-tax exclusion for your potential heirs; therefore the annual exclusion associated with the gift tax can help reduce the overall value of an individual’s estate during their lifetime, without impacting the individual’s lifetime estate tax exemption.</p>
                <p>Remember, with the current possible legislation changes to tax law – specifically the possible repeal of the estate tax (or an increase in the estate tax exemption amount) – this all may soon change. </p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>If this all sounds terribly complex, it’s because it is. That’s why consulting a professional is often a good idea when you’re navigating through the realm of taxes, even if they’re only relevant after you’re gone.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stocks finished modestly higher for the week as tax reform and Bitcoin mania dominated financial headlines. A strong jobs report Friday also contributed. The Senate and House are still working to reconcile tax bills, and appear relatively close. Ultimately, the main feature of the reform is likely to be a lower corporate tax rate – though the amount companies actually pay now varies widely, so not all companies will benefit. On the individual side, there will be cuts for most taxpayers, but they are modest. Those in high tax states may see their effective tax rate increase. So far, although most Americans do not approve of the tax bill, stock prices have been enthusiastic about its passage. </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,652 (+0.4%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (-0.1%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.38% (+0.02%)<br />
                Gold: $1,248 (-2.5%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.177 (-1.1%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:    </strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Monday – Tesla is seeking to raise $131 million in solar asset-backed securities from its often overlooked residential division.</li>
                <li>Monday – The House voted to go to conference with the Senate on the Republican tax bill.</li>
                <li>Tuesday – Nestle agreed to buy Atrium Innovations for $2.3 billion.</li>
                <li>Thursday – GE announced it would eliminate 12,000 power jobs after misjudging demand.</li>
                <li>Thursday – Bitcoin shot past $15,000 even as $70 million of the currency was stolen from NiceHash, a crypto-mining company.</li>
                <li>Thursday – Senator Al Franken announced he would resign amid sexual harassment allegations, making him the highest profile of a growing list of lawmakers impacted.</li>
                <li>Friday – Non-farm payrolls increased by 228,000, signaling a strong job market and holding the unemployment rate at 4.1%.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Our Take:</strong><br />
                Bitcoin’s meteoric rise accelerated this week. After recently passing the $10,000 mark, it rocketed as high as $17,000 on Friday before dropping to about $14,000 and finishing the day at just under $16,000 (depending on which price source you use). Stories of instant riches are stoking envy and causing more and more retail investors to want in the action. The media is awash with opinions, and they vary wildly. Some Bitcoin supporters are suggesting a $50,000 price is within reach, while many suggest the whole thing is a bubble and will come crashing at any moment. </p>
                <p>In our view, all of these predictions are worthless. As an Investment Committee, we are frequently asked our opinion. The answer may be disappointing, but at least it is honest &#8211; we don’t know where Bitcoin prices are headed. What we do know is that Bitcoin is not backed by any real assets or expected future cash flows in the way a stock or bond is, and it has little industrial use at this point beyond illicit transactions. For these reasons, we choose not to include it in client portfolios. We also suspect increased regulation will happen, though a case could be made that this would be good or bad for crypto-currencies. </p>
                <p>In the meantime, there is a market for it and so it will be worth whatever people are willing to pay. That is not much different than art or fine wine except that the increase in price has been much more dramatic. We think everyone must acknowledge that there is a chance prices go significantly higher and a chance they plummet. It is up to each person to decide if they want to gamble on it. </p>
                <p>If you believe there is a much better chance prices will spike than fall, or an even chance but with higher upside, it may be worth the risk with money you can afford to lose. We’re comfortable sitting this one out and are reminded that envy is never a good reason for a trade.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The nine-year bull market has helped fatten most investment portfolios, which is a welcome relief for many investors who have lingering memories of the Great Recession. However, the bull market may have also created a rebalancing “problem” that some investors are reluctant to fix because they don’t want to miss out on returns. Of course, high returns are not a bad thing by any stretch of the imagination, but they do create a challenge nonetheless. </p>
                <p>Why? </p>
                <p>Because of a little thing called rebalancing.</p>
                <h2>What is Rebalancing?</h2>
                <p>If you’re unfamiliar with the term, rebalancing essentially means keeping your investment portfolio in line with your long-term strategy. If you have a diversified investment strategy, then you most likely selected a mix of assets that matched your long-term goals. To maintain that same ratio of stocks, bonds and other assets, you need to periodically rebalance your portfolio by redistributing your funds so the original proportion remains consistent.</p>
                <p>Here’s a simple example: Let’s say you allocated your investments to a simple 70-30 mix with 70% stocks and 30% bonds. Over time, this 70-30 split becomes unbalanced due to the differing performances of stocks and bonds. This shift alters the risk level in your portfolio and, to keep your risk aligned with your financial plan, must be readjusted on a regular basis—usually annually.</p>
                <p>During the prolonged bull market, stocks have far outperformed bonds, so a portfolio that has not been regularly rebalanced is likely strongly skewed toward stocks—and may be more risky than the investor may have intended.</p>
                <h2>Why Should You Rebalance Away From Strong Returns?</h2>
                <p>Given the long-term strength of the stock market, you might think that if stocks are doing well, you should let them ride. Why not stick with winners, right? That’s where the resolve comes in. It can be very difficult to consider selling high-flying stocks to invest in limp-along bonds, for example. In fact, some investors choose to stick with high-producing investments despite the imbalance issues this causes.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, this decision could create future problems for your overall financial plan. Let’s say stocks now represent 85% of your portfolio, up from the 70% you prefer. If the stock market drops, your assets could take a much bigger hit than you originally expected. To rebalance, you must sell sufﬁcient stocks to reduce back to 70% and then use the proceeds to buy bonds to increase that allocation. In fact, if the stock market continues to rise, you will need to keep selling to maintain your original stocks-to-bonds allocation. At one level, it doesn’t seem to make much sense to sell successful assets to buy less successful assets, but there are some very good reasons for maintaining your preferred asset mix, including:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Rebalancing increases your opportunity to sell at the top and buy at a low—something all successful investors strive to do.</li>
                <li>Locking in profits along the way prevents you from losing, possibly overnight, much of your paper gains.</li>
                <li>Keeping your asset mix in line helps keeps volatility in check because your portfolio maintains its diversification.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>The key is to establish a diversified investment portfolio that fits your personal investment style, your risk-tolerance level, and your long-term goals. Then stick with it — rebalancing as needed to maintain your specified asset mix.</p>
                <p>Here are some basic rebalancing steps:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Don’t worry about minor imbalance. You’re looking to rebalance on, approximately, an annual basis or when your asset balance is off by a significant amount, which will depend on your overall allocation to each asset class.</li>
                <li>Look for ways to rebalance that will harvest profits. For example, you can simply prune positions in certain stocks that have done well, if you have individual stocks in your portfolio.</li>
                <li>Be mindful of the tax consequences, if you are rebalancing a taxable portfolio. For tax reasons, you may want to sell in ways that match losses and wins to keep taxes at a minimum.</li>
                <li>Consider the overall diversification of your portfolio, so that your ending asset mix fits your desired asset-allocation strategy. Enjoying bull market returns is gratifying, but your long-term strategy should be your utmost concern.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>A professional financial advisor can help you modify your strategic investment plan to maintain your optimal asset mix and keep your portfolio balanced.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>With the holidays approaching, charitable giving is top of mind for many people. In addition to helping those who are less fortunate, you may also be able to reap valuable tax benefits by giving money and assets to qualified charities.</p>
                <p>Here are some steps you might think about to obtain tax benefits when making charitable donations.</p>
                <h2>Make Outright Charitable Gifts</h2>
                <p>You can generally deduct cash, securities and property donated to qualified charitable organizations — which are also referred to as 501(c)(3) organizations — on your federal income tax return. Religious institutions and organizations like the Salvation Army, Goodwill Industries and the United Way typically qualify as 501(c)(3) organizations.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind that the total amount you can deduct for charitable contributions may be limited if your adjusted gross income (AGI) exceeds certain limits. Your annual charitable deduction is also generally limited to no more than 50% of your AGI (although 20% and 30% limitations apply to some kinds of donations and charitable organizations).</p>
                <p>Charitable donations are only deductible if you itemize deductions on your tax return, which you’ll list on Schedule A (Form 1040). If you claim the standard deduction, however, you can’t deduct your charitable contributions.</p>
                <p>Qualified charitable donations you make by December 31, 2017, may be deducted on your 2017 income tax return. If you wait until after this date to make a donation, you’ll have to wait until you file your 2018 tax return to take the deduction.</p>
                <h2>Keep Good Records</h2>
                <p>It’s important to keep good records supporting your charitable donations in case you need to substantiate them to the IRS. For cash contributions, retain a canceled check, bank statement, credit card statement, receipt, or letter from the charity that shows the charity’s name and the date and amount of the contribution. For contributions of $250 or more, you must have a written acknowledgement of the donation from the charity.</p>
                <p>For non-cash contributions valued at less than $500, you will need to obtain a receipt from the charity that contains a description of the property you’ve donated. For these types of contributions that are valued between $500 and $5,000, you must obtain an acknowledgement that includes how and when you obtained the property and the cost or other basis. And for non-cash contributions valued above $5,000, you must obtain a written appraisal of the property from a qualified appraiser.</p>
                <h2>Establish a Charitable Foundation</h2>
                <p>If you plan to make relatively large charitable contributions, you might benefit from establishing a charitable foundation. These can take several different forms, including a private family foundation, community foundation, or Donor Advised Fund (DAF).</p>
                <p>A private family foundation would make grants to charitable organizations you choose. A community foundation is similar but would be administered by outside professionals who direct your contributions as they see fit in order to benefit the designated community. And a DAF is similar to these but is easier and less expensive to set up and maintain.</p>
                <p>A DAF is a fund established in your name at a specific charitable organization. It exists within a pool of money managed by the charity on behalf of multiple donors. You can decide how your contributions of cash and property are invested and distributed while receiving a deduction during the year when contributions are made.</p>
                <h2>Use Trusts as a Charitable Giving Tool</h2>
                <p>Charitable trusts can be a valuable tool for giving away assets to charities in a tax-advantaged manner after you die. There are two main types of charitable trusts:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Charitable Remainder Trust (CRT) — You would contribute cash or property to the trust and receive income (or your beneficiaries would receive income) for a certain number of years. Assets that remain in the trust after your death would pass to the designated charity tax-free in most situations.</li>
                <li>Charitable Lead Trust (CRT) — You would contribute cash or property to the trust and the charity would receive income for a certain number of years. Assets that remain in the trust after your death would pass to your beneficiaries tax-free in most situations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>‘Tis the season for charitable giving. Remember, in order to claim tax deductions for charitable contributions on your 2017 tax return, you must make contributions no later than December 31, 2017 &#8211; so you should likely start setting your year-end charitable giving priorities now while there’s still some time to get organized. A financial advisor can help you figure out how charitable giving fits into your overall financial plan. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Enthusiasm around tax cuts drove U.S. stocks higher while international stocks lost ground. On Wednesday, technology and other high-momentum stocks sold off, causing some to question if this year’s high flyers can continue their run. On Friday, stocks dipped when former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about inappropriate contact with the Russian ambassador between the election and President Trump’s inauguration. Some reports also suggest Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner was involved in setting up the meetings. Congress moved closer to a tax bill but entered the weekend without a full agreement.</p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,642 (+1.5%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (-0.9%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.36% (+0.02%)<br />
                Gold: $1,280 (-0.6%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.190 (-0.3%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:    </strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Tuesday – Buffalo Wild Wings agreed to be purchased by Arby’s for $2.9 billion.</li>
                <li>Tuesday – DHL said it pre-ordered 10 of Tesla’s upcoming semi-trucks.</li>
                <li>Tuesday – A regulator warned Wells Fargo it is considering additional enforcement actions after new improprieties have surfaced in auto insurance and mortgage operations.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – NASDAQ said it plans to launch Bitcoin futures in 2018.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – CVS was said to be moving closer to a deal to buy Aetna for around or more than $66 billion.</li>
                <li>Thursday – Verizon said it would begin selling broadband internet over its wireless network to select cities in 2018, posing a threat to traditional cable companies.</li>
                <li>Friday – Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to FBI officers about communications with the Russian ambassador between the election and inauguration.</li>
                <li>Friday – Senate Republicans said they have enough votes to pass a sweeping tax reform bill.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Our Take:</strong><br />
                Michael Flynn, who briefly served as national security advisor for President Trump, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about conversations with the Russian ambassador. He seemingly was trying to influence Russian policy before Trump was inaugurated, which is a big no-no. It has been reported that the instruction came from Jared Kushner or someone high in Trump’s team, but it is yet to be seen who knew what and when. The situation increases political risk which has ebbed and flowed since the termination of FBI Director James Comey earlier this year. </p>
                <p>Markets will react if the situation intensifies, but we advise against trying to guess how. Even if things escalate, there is no way to know with confidence how the market would react. When Bill Clinton was impeached in 1998, markets barely budged and then continued to surge about 30% higher before the dot.com bubble finally imploded. Politics remain just one factor among many. Tax reform, Fed policy and overall valuations may be just as or more important to stock prices. We will just have to wait and see what unfolds. It will be interesting.</p>
                <p>Separately, the tax bill seems to be getting close. Markets have been cheering for this. As mentioned above, we generally don’t believe in trying to make timing bets around political or legislative actions, but investors should not be caught off-guard if there is a “sell on the news” situation if/when the bill finally passes. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The U.S. Senate narrowly approved a tax overhaul on Saturday and it includes a proposal that will generate more tax revenues for the federal government by restricting choices for some taxable investors. The proposed change is all about timing and two acronyms—HIFO and FIFO. HIFO stands for “Highest In, First Out” and FIFO stands for “First In, First Out.”</p>
                <p>Under current tax law, investors with taxable accounts are free to choose which shares of a specific company they would like to sell. Under the new proposal, investors must sell their oldest shares first. While that doesn’t sound like much of a change, it’s a very big deal from a capital gains perspective. </p>
                <p>Here’s a simple example: You purchased 100 shares of Flooble for $10,000 in 2000. At the time, the shares cost you $100 each. In 2005, you purchased 50 shares of Flooble for $10,000. Those shares cost $200 each. In 2015, you purchased an additional 25 shares, paying $10,000, or $400 a share. Each time you purchased a block of shares you created separate tax lots. In this example, you would own three tax lots. Currently, Flooble sells for $300 per share. You have a total of 175 shares, which are worth $52,500, so you’re ahead $22,500. </p>
                <p>Or are you? Under current law &#8211; for tax purposes &#8211; you could show a loss. You could choose to sell the 25 shares you purchased last using HIFO accounting. Remember, those shares cost you $400 each when you purchased them, but they are now worth just $300 each, so technically you lost $100 per share. Choosing to use HIFO shares means you could use this “loss” to help offset other gains, which works to minimize or eliminate capital gains taxes within a taxable investment portfolio. </p>
                <p>The Senate’s proposal would eliminate your flexibility. If you wanted to sell shares of Flooble, you would be forced to use FIFO accounting. In other words, you would be forced to sell some of the shares from your first tax lot. In this example, it would be the shares you purchased for $100 each. If you sold 25 of those shares, you would have a taxable gain of $200 per share, since you purchased the shares for $200 less than what they’re currently selling for ($300 per share). </p>
                <p>In either case, you now own 150 shares of Flooble, but your tax position is vastly different. Under current law (using HIFO), you could report a loss of $2,500 from the transaction. Under the proposed law (using FIFO), you would be forced to report a profit of $5,000, which would be subject to capital gains taxes.</p>
                <p>The FIFO provision in the Senate’s tax proposal creates significant new tax concerns for investors with taxable portfolios. (So far, the Senate’s bill excludes mutual funds from this provision.) Of course, tax reform is extremely fluid, so no one can say if this provision will remain in the finalized bill. However, it is something to watch closely, since the end of 2017 may be the last opportunity to use HIFO accounting as a tax-management tool within your taxable portfolio.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you are like lots of investors, you’ve probably never heard of sequence risk — also called sequence-of-returns risk — but it is a particularly pertinent concept for those nearing or just entering retirement. </p>
                <p>Simply put: Sequence risk refers to the order or the timing in which your investment returns occur. It specifically relates to the risk of early declines and ongoing withdrawals impacting your spending during a certain period of time, most often in retirement.</p>
                <p>It is this concept that helps explains why two retirees with the same wealth levels might not have the same retirement experience, even if their long-term return averages look the same. </p>
                <h2>An Example of Sequence Risk &#038; Retirement</h2>
                <p>Let’s say your friend, Sam, retired five years ago with a $1 million nest egg and at the end of his first year in retirement and every year thereafter, he withdrew $50,000 per year as part of his annual income. If his nest egg grew 10% each year for the first three years, but dropped 5% each year for the next two years, at the end of five years his remaining nest egg would be $954,364. Overall, he weathered the two-year downturn fairly well. </p>
                <p>Now, what if you retired with the same $1 million nest egg and you withdrew the same $50,000 each year, but your nest egg dropped 5% per year for the first two years and grew 10% per year for the next three years? Your remaining nest egg would be $905,955. </p>
                <p>In this scenario, you didn’t fare as well as Sam. Overall, each person experienced the same amount of growth and the same losses, but your portfolio is $48,409 behind Sam’s results because of sequence risk—you experienced losses early in the five-year cycle. </p>
                <p>This example illustrates how two retirees with the same wealth levels can experience different retirement results—sometimes significantly different results. </p>
                <p>Consider the bad timing of a person who retired September 29, 2008, when the stock market fell 777 points, the largest single-day drop in history. While every investor faced the same drop that day, our newly retired individual had an added challenge. At some point, he must make a withdrawal for living expenses, and he must continue to make an annual withdrawal if he sticks with his retirement plan. </p>
                <p>When you take withdrawals from your portfolio, instead of making contributions, the timing of gains or losses can make a significant difference in your overall results, despite long-term averages. The most critical time is right before or right after you retire—generally within a five-year period on either side of retirement. This period is so important because an early reduction in your nest egg could impact your future for years to come. That’s because you subject the portfolio to a double dip (returns and withdrawals) at the same time and that leaves less money to recover over the long term.</p>
                <h2>What Should You Do if You Encounter Sequence Risk?</h2>
                <p>First, don’t panic. You need to keep your assets invested to earn sufficient returns to maintain your retirement lifestyle. And trying to time market cycles is a nearly impossible task.</p>
                <p>Fortunately, understanding the impact of sequence risk on your portfolio means you can take steps to diminish any potential negative impact. The crux of the sequence-risk challenge is the need to systemically drawdown assets—which is an element you can control through planning.</p>
                <p>One potential solution is to build a retirement plan that incorporates some flexibility regarding how you obtain your annual withdrawal. For example, keep some funds &#8211; perhaps enough to equal at least one year’s withdrawal &#8211; in cash or cash equivalents, such as money market funds. This flexibility helps keep your investment portfolio on the same footing as other long-term investors during market downturns, which allows you to alleviate much of the significance of sequence risk.</p>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>Of course, every investor’s circumstance is different, so finding the most effective investment positioning is highly individualized. That’s where seeking advice comes in. If you are nearing retirement, it would be a good time to consult with a financial advisor regarding the asset mix in your investment portfolio. During your working years, you may have been primarily focused on investment growth, but you may now want focus on smoothing out volatility by taking a bit more conservative approach. </p>
                <p>Remember, that does not mean abandoning the stock market because you are still a long-term investor—you could spend one, two or more decades in retirement, so you’ll still need a focus on growth to combat inflation and increase the longevity of your assets. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After nine years, some investors are getting increasingly worried about the continued viability of the long-running bull market. Add in the rumors of rising interest rates, and some investors are ready to make dramatic changes to their equity investments, such as moving a significant portion of their portfolio to cash or cash equivalents (money market funds or ultra-short bonds).</p>
                <h2>Changing Your Asset Allocation</h2>
                <p>Before you let your nerves rule your investment strategy, consider that changing your asset allocation based on nerves  is something your financial advisor would probably caution against if you are properly allocated. There are a couple of reasons for this. First, in the investment world, keeping cash in your portfolio is referred to as “cash drag.” This means your portfolio will likely trail market returns because cash does not generate significant returns in comparison to the market over time.</p>
                <p>The second reason is when you change your asset allocation based on nerves, you are engaging in “market timing,” which is seldom profitable long term.</p>
                <p>Here’s the problem: While the bull market has been running strong for nine years, it’s impossible to correctly determine when that cycle will change. If you decide to move a significant amount of your portfolio to some form of cash, you could miss several more months (even years) of solid equity-market returns. Or, the market could immediately drop right after you sell—then what will you do? Will it be time to move back into equities? All your decisions will depend on correctly reading the future, not just once, but twice.</p>
                <h2>The Challenges of Timing the Market</h2>
                <p>That’s the trouble with market timing. To win, you must correctly predict market cycles. First, you must predict when to sell an asset class. Now? Next week? The end of the year? You don’t have a crystal ball, so you can’t possibly know the correct answer.</p>
                <p>If you correctly guess when to sell, you’re not free from the market-timing trap. In fact, you’re just halfway there. Now, you must figure out when to get back in. If the market drops 600 points in a day, will you dive back in? Will you wait for a full week of falling returns or a terrible month of returns? What if you wait for a bad month, buy back in and the market continues to fall? Will you bail again?</p>
                <p>Even if you are looking like a genius because you successfully timed both sides of the market, did you really make any money? That depends on the size of your gains and the cost of trading in and out of the market. If your gains are relatively modest, trading costs may eat up most of your profits.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>We caution against market timing because the large number of unknowns that you must get right, coupled with the costs of making all those moves. Instead, we encourage clients to stay calm and remain focused on long-term investing goals, making portfolio changes based on personal circumstances, not market cycles.</p>
                <p>If you now understand the pitfalls of market timing, but you are still nervous about your portfolio, you may have another issue. Your anxiety may be revealing that your risk-tolerance level and your investment strategy are misaligned. In this case, a financial advisor can help you re-evaluate your initial strategy. This would be an example of a personal circumstance that may require a portfolio adjustment to match your investment personality.</p>
                <p>A professional financial advisor can help you identify the source of your investment anxiety and, if necessary, help you make adjustments based on your strategic plan — not on arbitrary market cycles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dow, S&#038;P, and Nasdaq all finished the shortened trading week with strong weekly gains, S&#038;P closed above 2,600 for the first time in anticipation of a strong holiday shopping season. Tech stocks advanced 1.8% this week, leading all other sectors. </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,602.42 (+.90%)<br />

                <li>Friday –  Online spending up 18% on Black Friday vs. 2016</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our take:</h2>
                <p>While all eyes may be focused on the proposed tax bill in Washington, you shouldn’t forget about fine tuning any last-minute tax items for 2017 year-end tax planning. Often, the best action items will depend on whether you see your income going up or down next year. Here are some factors that can be relevant to your situation:</p>
                <p><strong>Marriage &#038; Taxes</strong><br />
                Getting married and you both will have significant income? You may be facing a potential higher tax bracket for married couples next year. You might want to consider accelerating some income into the current year or deferring deduction into 2018 </p>
                <p><strong>Employer Sponsored Retirement Plans</strong><br />
                In most cases, fully funding your company 401k with pretax dollars will reduce current-year taxes and increase your retirement nest egg. </p>
                <p><strong>Capital Gains &#038; Losses</strong><br />
                Will you have any gains or losses that can be off set? If you have losses, it could make sense to accelerate more gains this year so you don’t have to push them into next year. If you have gains, review any positions that could make sense to sell this year to keep them at a lower amount. </p>
                <p><strong>Reporting Healthcare Coverage</strong><br />
                According to the IRS, if your tax return does not indicate whether you and your family had healthcare coverage during the year, your return will not be processed. This is the first year that the IRS is refusing to process returns if this information is omitted from the return.</p>
                <p><strong>Flex Spending Accounts</strong><br />
                Most FSA accounts will not carry any money over to the next year. Some employers will allow you to use it until March of 2018. You should check with your employer to see if they give employees the optional grace period to March 15.</p>
                <p><strong>Vacation Home Rentals</strong><br />
                If you rent out a vacation home that you also use for personal purposes, you should review the number of days it was used for business versus pleasure to see if there are ways to maximize tax savings with respect to that property.</p>
                <p><strong>Required Minimum Distributions (RMDs)</strong><br />
                Taxpayers 70 1/2 years old and older who own an IRA are required to take minimum distributions from that account each year and include those amounts in taxable income. Make sure you review all your accounts and take that distribution to avoid a 50% penalty. If you don’t need the income and are concerned about being bumped up to another tax bracket, you can utilize charitable giving. A special rule allows you to make a charitable contribution directly from your IRA to a charity. You may be able to deduct the amount as an itemized deduction. By making the contribution directly to a charity, it counts towards your RMD and that amount will not be included in income. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While lots of uncertainty remains, overhauling the federal tax code includes several proposed changes that may result in altered choices for some homebuyers and owners. The U.S. Senate bill and the House bill differ on numerous points, so the dickering involved in the reconciliation process could dramatically change the final proposal. However, let’s look at what is currently on the table, from both proposals, in terms of the potential impact of reform on residential real estate.</p>
                <p>There are three important residential real estate taxation changes proposed. They include: </p>
                <ul>
                <li>Mortgage interest deductions</li>
                <li>Property tax deductions</li>
                <li>Capital gains tax exclusions</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Mortgage Interest Deductions</h2>
                <p>Today, qualifying mortgage interest can be deducted on residential loans up to $1 million dollars. What’s more, this loan cap can apply to a maximum of two houses—a primary home and a vacation home. You can also deduct interest on an additional qualifying home-equity loan up to $100,000.</p>
                <p>The House and Senate have proposed different changes to this deduction. The House wants to halve the loan-cap for qualified mortgage interest deductions to a maximum of $500,000. It also proposes to eliminate this deduction on a vacation home, making it available only on a primary residence.</p>
                <p>The Senate wants to maintain the $1 million cap, but its bill proposes to eliminate the ability to deduct interest on a qualified home equity loan. </p>
                <p>So why should you care?</p>
                <p>Proposed changes, particularly the House version, could impact homebuyers in areas with high home prices. A cap of $500,000 in California or New York may be easily reached, even by those looking for relatively modest accommodations. Minus a deduction for interest for higher mortgages, some buyers may opt for a less expensive home.</p>
                <h2>Property Tax Deduction</h2>
                <p>Currently, homeowners can deduct state and local (property) taxes (SALT) from their federal tax bill. However, this deduction is targeted by both the House and Senate versions of federal tax reform. </p>
                <p>In the House version, homeowners will be able to deduct property taxes up to a maximum of $10,000. In the Senate version, property taxes will simply not be deductible. </p>
                <p>Again, the proposed changes tend to impact certain markets. While homeowners in most parts of the country pay less than $10,000 annually in property taxes, taxpayers in states with high property taxes and high home prices will surely feel a wallet pinch if either option remains in the final tax-reform plan.</p>
                <h2>Capital Gains Tax Exclusions</h2>
                <p>Both the House and Senate bills appear to be in lockstep regarding changes to capital-gains tax exclusions. Currently, you can use a federal tax exclusion to protect up to $250,000 in profits as an individual ($500,000 for couples) from capital-gains taxes when you sell your home. To qualify, the property you sold must have been your primary residence for at least two out of the past five years. There is no limit on how many times this exclusion can be used, if the residency requirement is met. </p>
                <p>Both the House and Senate propose to make a simple, but highly important, change to this exclusion—they propose to extend the time of residency to five out of the past eight years.<br />
                This could have a significant impact on some homeowners. For example, if you are considering buying a primary residence, but your lifestyle is fluid, you may owe capital gains taxes on profits if you sell before the five-year residency requirement. </p>
                <p>The proposed requirement also dashes plans for homebuyers who have rentals that they planned to convert to primary residences before selling. Because current law does not limit the number of times this exclusion can be used, some enterprising people move into their rental properties for two years before selling them. This shelters as much as $500,000, for married couples, from capital gains taxes for each rental property. </p>
                <p>Hypothetically, a couple nearing or just entering retirement could liquidate three or four houses in a period of six to eight years using the current exclusion. This would protect significant profits on all properties from capital gains taxes—and potentially add thousands to a retirement nest egg. Under tax reform, a similar liquidation plan would require a 15-to20-year commitment—a much more onerous proposition.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>It certainly makes sense to add these potential tax changes into your thinking process if you are buying, selling or accumulating residential property. But, like real estate, itself, much of the impact—if any—will depend on location, location, location.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Financial transparency on a whole may have increased, but too many Americans still don’t understand just how much they are actually paying their advisors. In a recent survey Harris Poll conducted on our behalf, we found that 61% of Americans don’t know how much they pay in investment fees.</p>
                <p>Over the course of a lifetime, hidden fees can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars – dollars that should be padding your golden years instead of lining your financial advisor or product seller’s pockets.</p>
                <p>Our latest study, <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/report-what-americans-pay-in-advisory-fees" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Hidden Beneath the Surface: What Americans Are Paying in Advisory Fees</a>, shines a light on the wide range of fees charged to clients and the difficulty consumers have in identifying them. We used publicly available advisory fee schedules and actual fund fee data from Personal Capital dashboard users to estimate fee ranges at each institution. </p>
                <p>While these estimates don’t represent the average fees across all advisory clients at each firm, they reflect what an investor could potentially pay if charged full advisory fees through the listed programs, combined with fund fees in line with what we have observed across a broad sample of accounts in our own data. As always, investors should consult their individual advisors for their specific fee. </p>
                <h2>Estimated Fees by Institution</h2>
                <p>In order to create viable comparisons between different firms and compute the impact of fees, we assumed a hypothetical investor and evaluated certain investment advisory firms based on selected criteria, such as the investable asset range is between $100,000 and $1 million, and the firm must have a major national presence. For a full look at the methodology, please see below</p>

                <h2>Methodology</h2>
                <p>We assumed a hypothetical investor applying the following criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The investable asset range is between $100,000 and $1,000,000</li>
                <li>The investor seeks a managed account with guidance from a human advisor—purely algorithmic “robo-advisor” options were excluded</li>
                <li>The portfolio consists of individual stocks, bonds, mutual funds, or ETFs</li>
                <li>The effects of tax consequences are excluded</li>
                <li>The costs tied to electronic funds transfer and wire fees, IRA and retirement plan fees, margin interest, ADR fees, account opening or closing fees, or other account-level transactional fees, which can be significant with firms that don’t have a single all-in fee, are also excluded</li>
                </ul>
                <p>To select the investment advisory firms for this study, we used the following criteria:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The firm must have a major national presence</li>
                <li>The firm must have a statistically viable number of users in our database</li>
                <li>The firm must have fee data we can identify and interpret</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Given these criteria, the scope of this study includes a representative sample of firms for which Personal Capital has a significant sample of users. There are numerous small regional firms, for example, that were excluded due to the first condition, and a handful of nationally prominent firms that were excluded due to the second or third condition. Nevertheless, we believe the list we’ve compiled is representative of the general range of costs and is therefore useful investor education.</p>
                <p>Moreover, the difficulty in constructing an accurate and comprehensive list of available options in the universe of financial institutions speaks to a broader point—fees are very hard to detect and compare—and the odds are stacked against the average investor when it comes to comparing fees across different organizations. </p>
                <p>Fee schedules are frequently complicated, thick with legalese, and too often come with hidden charges that are separate from the  main schedule (not unlike the airline industry). In other words, considering the difficulty financial services experts had finding this information, even with all the technology, data science, and data we have for over 1.5 million users of our tools, the average investor faces a comparatively daunting challenge.  </p>
                <p>Our methodology takes into account only two narrow definitions of fees. In the real world, there are many other fees that can add to an investor’s total cost, as well. For example, brokerages sometimes charge additional commissions to trade in and out of individual stocks or bonds. They also frequently sell products like insurance and annuities, which can add another 1%-2% in fees per year. Even worse, they often come with stiff surrender clauses, meaning an investor could lose up to 10% of an investment when pulling out money for an emergency or other spending need. None of these charges are reflected in our analysis, but should be considered before evaluating any firm or the actual performance of the investments.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stocks struggled to find their footing, ending the week in slightly negative territory. Much of the news surrounded tax legislation, with the U.S. House of Representatives successfully passing its overhaul bill, and moving it through to the Senate, which has been working on its own version. All is still uncertain, but there were more similarities between the two bills than differences, which could potentially increase the likelihood that something gets passed.  </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,579 (-0.1)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (-0.2%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.34% (-0.06%)<br />
                Gold: $1,294 (+1.4%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.179 (+1.1%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Monday – Private-equity firm Roark Capital made a bid for Buffalo Wild Wings valued at more than $2.3 billion.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – Russia agreed to restructure $3 billion worth of Venezuelan debt to alleviate pressure on the cash-strapped nation.</li>
                <li>Thursday – Wal-Mart posted better-than-expected quarterly results, sending shares of the retailer sharply higher.</li>
                <li>Thursday – U.S. inflation readings came in soft, with the price index for personal consumption expenditures flat in June over the prior month.</li>
                <li>Thursday – The U.S. House of Representatives voted 227-205 in favor of its new tax bill, which now moves to the Senate.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Our take: </strong><br />
                It’s not often you see a stock like Walmart move more than 10% in a single day. In fact, there have been only two such instances in the last 20 years. But the retailer did just that on Thursday following better-than-expected third quarter results. This included a 4.2% increase in total revenue and roughly 2% growth in adjusted earnings per share, primarily on the back of higher in-store traffic and a double-digit increase in online sales.</p>
                <p>But why would these results drive such an outsized stock move? It all boils down to Amazon. There’s been a growing sense of fear that the Seattle-based tech giant will drive virtually all retailers out of business, particularly those with brick-and-mortar stores. And in some cases this is actually happening. </p>
                <p>But Walmart’s results demonstrate it’s not all doom and gloom for traditional retailers. The company has found success changing its long-standing business model, focusing more heavily on its online presence and reducing the expansion of physical stores. </p>
                <p>Of course it’s far too early to declare victory over Amazon, but clearly it’s possible for other firms to compete. Walmart understands its predicament—the competitive environment has changed, and if it hopes to stay relevant it must adapt accordingly. It’s a lesson many retailers will need to learn.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Bitcoin has had an eventful 2017. </p>
                <p>Starting the year at just under $1,000 per coin, Bitcoin has recently spiked to over $7,000 this month. 2017 has marked an all-time high for bitcoin trading volume. The market for bitcoin never closes, and nearly anyone in the world with an Internet connection can be a participant. </p>
                <img src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-Price-of-Bitcoin.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46943" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-Price-of-Bitcoin.jpg 2448w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-Price-of-Bitcoin-300x194.jpg 300w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-Price-of-Bitcoin-768x498.jpg 768w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/2017-Price-of-Bitcoin-735x476.jpg 735w" sizes="(max-width: 2448px) 100vw, 2448px" />
                <p>However, some surprising trends are also emerging amid the froth. For example, the pace of bitcoin acceptance as a payment method seems to have slowed among legitimate retailers. Bloomberg reported in July 2017  that of the leading 500 Internet sellers, only three are accepting bitcoin, which is down from five last year. Merchants have not seen much demand for bitcoin payments, and many customers report that they’d rather use fiat currencies and hold their bitcoins for appreciation. A common complaint was that converting bitcoin to other currencies can come with high fees, making it less attractive as a payment system.</p>
                <p>It’s becoming clear that bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general are finding more success as an asset class and potential store of value than as a medium of exchange. Just as someone would not buy a Diet Coke with gold bullion, neither are they willing to spend bitcoin directly on goods and services. This limitation could be a blessing or a curse. Owning and trading bitcoin without ever converting to a fiat currency allows for faster transactions, fewer fees and lower tax exposure &#8211; but it also discourages any financial diversification beyond investing in other cryptocurrencies.</p>
                <p>While bitcoin is not finding much of a use-case beyond “digital gold,” the blockchain technology that it’s built on is being tested for diverse uses, such as registering marriage certificates, recording stock transactions, shipping container supply, and tracking the ownership of diamonds. And in a nod to the original use for a blockchain, any company or person desiring a private, trackable currency can now have one &#8211; provided they can get others to accept it. 2017 has been the year when many mainstream companies started seriously exploring blockchain technology, and the media has been taking note.</p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>Bitcoin seems to be riding the coattails of excitement about other blockchain possibilities, and there is no way to tell where the price will go from here. We continue to view any investment in a cryptocurrency as highly speculative. They have no underlying assets, cash flows, physical industrial value, or financial claims on any company. They also have no regulatory oversight to prevent fraud. Without anything linking them to actual economic growth other than their perceived scarcity, they are susceptible to huge price volatility. And as the value of blockchain-linked assets continues to grow, so too does the likelihood that governments will begin to view them as a threat to their sovereign ability to wield monetary policy and regulate commerce.</p>
                <p>We only consider or recommend investments that we believe have a positive expected return over long periods of time. Bitcoin may or may not survive, and blockchain technology will continue to evolve. Some investors have already made a lot of money buying bitcoins or blockchain tokens, and that may continue in the future. But to us it remains a wager, and not yet an asset with a role as part of a long-term investment strategy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>While most Americans are keeping an eye on the proposed Republican-led tax reform to determine if they will personally be in the winner’s or loser’s circle when it all shakes out, some savvy investors are looking at the bigger picture. </p>
                <p>Outside of the changes to income levels and deductions that are being floated, one notable change to the current tax code involves the proposed corporate tax cuts. For investors who are looking to add to their portfolios or are evaluating their current holdings, considering the consequences of the proposed tax overhaul makes sense. </p>
                <h2>How Will Corporations be Impacted?</h2>
                <p>The proposed corporate tax cuts are not created equal for all industries, which will create winners and losers at the corporate level. </p>
                <p>The Trump administration’s tax plan for 2018 could have a long-lasting impact on company earnings and valuations due to several reported features that are &#8211; at least currently &#8211; included in the proposed legislation. Three of those features include a reduction in corporate taxes, “repatriation” of foreign profits for U.S. companies, and a change in how companies expense capital investments. </p>
                <h2>Corporate Tax Reductions</h2>
                <p>The plan currently approved by the U.S. House of Representatives reduces corporate taxes from 35% to 20%. This would immediately free up cash for many corporations. What will those companies do with the extra money? Some obvious choices might be investing in the corporation’s infrastructure or making acquisitions, increasing dividends to shareholders, or making stock buybacks &#8211; all of which could benefit shareholders. However, this proposal comes with the loss of some current tax breaks for corporations, such as the ability to write off debt interest; this change could significantly impact corporations (especially ones that are highly leveraged). </p>
                <h2>Repatriation of Foreign Profits</h2>
                <p>The repatriation proposal in the tax reform bill allows U.S. companies to bring back profits made outside the United States at a proposed 12% tax rate. The Trump administration anticipates this enticement will contribute to jobs and economic growth. Certainly U.S. companies with a large foreign presence could return cash to the United States and use it for new investments, special dividends or other balance sheet-improving activities, which could benefit shareholders. However, the question is whether this tax rate represents enough incentive—or if the proposed rate will even survive the process to turn into law.</p>
                <h2>Expensing Capital Investments</h2>
                <p>Gaining the ability to immediately write off capital investments, rather than following a set depreciation schedule, is also currently proposed. This would generally be a boon for companies with high capital expenses. However, this proposal appears to be very much in flux largely because of the immediate cost of the proposal, which has some opponents concerned. </p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>While the tax picture for companies is apparently changing dramatically—and savvy investors may be able to reap the benefits—the legislation is very fluid. We do not know what current proposals will make the final legislation, or if there will even be final legislation. Additionally, if tax reform becomes a reality, any finalized corporate changes will impact entire industries and individual companies in vastly different ways. However, it makes sense for investors to immediately add this new twist to the criteria they currently use when valuing current holdings in an investment portfolio or before making new investment decisions. </p>
                <p>A professional financial advisor can help you assess how the pending tax-reforms may impact your investment portfolio, as well as to your personal financial circumstances. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Did you know that that 61% of Americans don’t know how much they pay in investment fees, according to a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/assets/email/2017-Personal-Capital-Financial-Trust-Report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">recent survey Harris Poll conducted</a> on our behalf? What’s more, only 26% of those polled agreed with the statement “My financial advisor only makes recommendations that are in my best interest.”</p>
                <p>Those numbers are alarming considering they’re related to consumers’ financial futures and those to whom they’re entrusting them. </p>
                <p>If you’re entrusting your golden years to someone, you should be able to trust him or her, right? The confusing thing is, this trust isn’t necessarily well-earned. Many financial advisors operate as broker-dealers, who are transaction-oriented and make money by charging commissions for selling securities or products such as mutual funds. Because their traditional role has been the sale of securities, and not objective advice, broker-dealers are not held to the fiduciary standard, which means they are not legally required to act in their clients’ best interests. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, registered investment advisors (RIAs), such as Personal Capital, are legally bound by the fiduciary standard, and typically charge a flat fee through their sole business of dispensing advice, not generating product commissions. Well, why wouldn’t you play it safe by just going with an RIA? The answer isn’t so simple. Some firms become dual-registered, which means they can continue to charge as broker-dealers, but also offer theoretically objective advice like an RIA.</p>
                <p>So what can you do to ensure you’re getting objective advice that isn’t based on earning commissions and other transactional charges? If you’re currently evaluating managers, or rethinking your current relationship, here are some important questions to ask to ensure you are receiving financial advice in your best interest. </p>
                <h2>Are you a fiduciary?</h2>
                <p>A fiduciary has a legal obligation to act in your best interest, including disclosing fees and any potential conflicts of interest. Brokers do not always have this legal obligation, but registered investment advisors (RIAs) do. Avoid an advisor who earns higher fees by pushing certain products. </p>
                <h2>Why did you recommend that investment</h2>
                <p>Ask your financial advisor if he or she is willing to invest in the same products that they recommend to you, or if they receive an incentive for recommending that product. Alternatively, you can also ask why they picked a product recommended over another similar offering. Do they have a fee-sharing arrangement with another company? </p>
                <h2>How are you compensated?</h2>
                <p>If the answer is vague or takes more than a minute to answer, walk away. You should also know what your all-in costs are and you understand how much you are paying per transaction, per product, or per service. Ask how much your financial advisor makes when he sells mutual funds, annuities, and individual stock or bond trades. Be sure to ask if those costs to you are in addition to the annual, or ongoing management fee he or she makes from working with you. </p>
                <h2>What service can I expect from you?</h2>
                <p>Ask your advisor what kind of on-going service you can expect. How often can you contact them and what can you expect in response times? Do they have online tools that allow you to review your account data in real time and perform what-if analyses? What materials do they provide so you can track how your investments are doing? Equally important, how do they keep your financial plan up to date? </p>
                <h2>What is your investment strategy, and how will it achieve my goals?</h2>
                <p>Does your advisor understand your specific needs and goals? Did you work together to build your long-term investment strategy? Ask your financial advisor what his or her investment strategy is, and most importantly, how it is customized for your specific needs, risk tolerance, age, and other financial priorities. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stocks delivered a rare loss this week, but it was a small one, and volatility remained mostly absent. Markets dealt with modest selling pressure late in the week as it became clearer that passing tax legislation this year will be difficult. Talks of delaying corporate tax cuts to 2019 also weighed. M&#038;A was active, led by an unsolicited $105 billion takeover bid for Qualcomm by Broadcom.  </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,582 (-0.2%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.5%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.40% (+0.07%)<br />
                Gold: $1,276 (+0.4%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.166 (+0.4)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Monday – Broadcom proposes to acquire Qualcomm for $105 billion.</li>
                <li>Monday – Walt Disney was said to have held talks to buy a large portion of 21st Century Fox’s entertainment division.</li>
                <li>Tuesday –Snapchat disclosed that China’s Tencent recently bought a 12% stake.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – The Saudi government was said to be aiming to confiscate up to $800 billion of cash and other assets in the wake of numerous arrests of high profile individuals over the weekend.</li>
                <li>Wednesday – Regulators suggested AT&#038;T may have to sell its Turner television unit or DirectTV in order to win approval to acquire TimeWarner.</li>
                <li>Thursday – The Senate unveiled its tax plan, including delaying corporate tax cuts to 2019.</li>
                <li>Friday – Hasbro, maker of Nerf and Monopoly, was said to have made an offer to acquire Mattel, maker of Barbie and Hot Wheels.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Our take:</strong><br />
                This week featured significant M&#038;A activity, highlighted by Broadcom’s unsolicited $105 billion bid for Qualcomm. Another big one that is further down the road is AT&#038;Ts acquisition of Time Warner. Somehow, as tech stocks dominate this long bull market, it feels appropriate to look back 17 years ago to when AOL was consuming Time Warner. To many, the deal marks the end of the dot.com bubble and goes down as one of the worst in history. But at the time, AOL seemed flawless. I remember working with client accounts at the time and AOL was the single most popular stock held in retail portfolios. People were very emotionally attached and often upset at the suggestion of selling. It was hard for many to fathom at the time that things could change fast. But they can, and nothing about that has changed. </p>
                <p>Here is an interesting quote from Gerald Levin, who was CEO of Time Warner at the time: “I think it’s something that no one could have foreseen, and to this day, whether Apple is going to dominate entertainment or whether Amazon is going to dominate publishing, all the old business plans are out the window. AOL was the Google of its time. It was how you got to the Internet, but it was using some old media business ideas that were undone by the Internet itself, and that’s why Google came along.” </p>
                <p>While AOL was never the most valuable company, it illustrates how hard it is to stay at or near the top. Just ask General Electric which lost its status as most valuable public company in 2008 to Microsoft which stayed on top for four years before Cisco overtook it. For what it is worth, Apple surpassed Exxon in 2012 as number one and hasn’t looked back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><a href="https://www.census.gov/construction/nrs/pdf/newressales.pdf">The median price of a home in the United States</a> was recently reported by the U.S. Census Bureau to be $319,700 (including the land on which the home sits).</p>
                <p>So what exactly does this number have to do with investment returns? It’s actually less than the total amount you could be losing to investment fees over time.</p>
                <p>Let’s take a look at an investor who pays a 1.0% annual fee and one who pays a 3.0% annual fee. While the differences between these two fees may sounds trivial, the impact over time can add up to $400,000 –  which is more than $80,000 over that median home price.</p>
                <p>Even a 1% difference (i.e., 2.0% vs. 1.0%) can cost an investor an extra $240,000 in fees over the full time horizon. What’s more, that doesn’t fully capture the amount the investor loses in total return. Because fees are taken out along the way, that money doesn’t have time to grow and compound. </p>
                <h2>The Total Amount an Investor Can Lose</h2>
                <p>To make it easier to visualize, the following table illustrates the hypothetical dollar amount of fees paid by an investor. It’s based on an investor beginning contributions of $18,000 to a 401k at the age of 21. Those contributions increase by 2% every year thereafter, and at the age of 50, the investor increases annual contributions by the “catch up” amount offered under <a href="https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-announces-2017-pension-plan-limitations-401k-contribution-limit-remains-unchanged-at-18000-for-2017" rel="noopener" target="_blank">current IRS guidelines</a> (also adjusted for inflation). The investor then stops making contributions at age 65. We’ll assume annual returns are 6% and that fees – as a percent of assets – remain level throughout.</p>
                <p><img src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/effect-of-fees-investment-returns.jpg" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46924" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/effect-of-fees-investment-returns.jpg 2449w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/effect-of-fees-investment-returns-300x200.jpg 300w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/effect-of-fees-investment-returns-768x511.jpg 768w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/effect-of-fees-investment-returns-715x476.jpg 715w" sizes="(max-width: 2449px) 100vw, 2449px" /><br />
                Based on these characteristics, the total amount an investor loses at 3% fee vs. 1% fee – including both fees and foregone returns – is more than $740,000. That’s more than two homes in the United States at the median price!</p>
                <h2>High Returns Don’t Necessarily Follow High Fees</h2>
                <p>We recently commissioned <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/assets/email/2017-Personal-Capital-Financial-Trust-Report.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a poll by Harris Poll</a> that found that 32% of respondents viewed higher fees for investment accounts as a price to pay for higher returns. However, <a href="https://www.ifa.com/articles/summary_of_academic_research_on_stock_picking/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">most academic studies</a> show that professional investors as a group actually don’t outperform broad market indices over long time horizons.</p>
                <p>What does this mean for you, and what can you do?</p>
                <p>As an investor, you should be aware of the fees you are paying (you can run our free <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/fee-analyzer" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Fee Analyzer</a> to see the impact of hidden fees on your retirement savings) and understand that even a small percentage difference in extra fees can seriously erode an account’s potential – and ultimately impact what you’re left with in retirement. If your primary objective is total portfolio return, then you’ll want to keep costs low. But keep in mind, low costs aren’t the only components you want to consider when it comes to a successful portfolio. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The House released an outline of a plan to make major changes to the current tax code last week &#8211; a move that is now making headline after headline as the plan heads through Congress and the president is prioritizing tax reform as a major part of his agenda.</p>
                <p>So what is the plan as it now stands, and what might this mean for you? Take a look below to see some high-level changes being proposed.</p>
                <h2>Married Couples Filing Jointly: 2017 vs. Proposed Tax Plan</h2>
                <p><img src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/proposed-income-tax-bracket.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46917" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/proposed-income-tax-bracket.png 707w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/proposed-income-tax-bracket-300x102.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 707px) 100vw, 707px" /><small><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/27/us/politics/six-charts-to-explain-the-republican-tax-plan.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source: New York Times</a></em></small></p>
                <p>Generally, the proposed plan lowers or maintains rates for five of the seven current income ranges, and increases rates in the other two.  It also reduces the number of income tax brackets from seven to four. </p>
                <p>Some other proposed changes include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>If you are among the wealthiest of tax payers, the tax rate remains the same, except the income level increases to $1 million for married couples. This is increased from $480,051 currently.</li>
                <li>The lowest income rate increases, but the plan aims to balance this with an increased standard deduction and a larger child tax credit.</li>
                <li>The plan also eliminates the Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT), and the estate tax on inheritances, which currently impacts those inheriting $5.49 million. This repeal will take place over six years, during which time, the proposal will double the amount of exempted inherited wealth to $11.2 million per person ($22.4 million total for married couples).</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Standard Deductions &#8211; 2017 vs. Proposed Tax Plan</h2>
                <p><img src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/standard-deductions.png" alt="" class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46918" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/standard-deductions.png 472w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/standard-deductions-300x186.png 300w" sizes="(max-width: 472px) 100vw, 472px" /><small><em><a href="https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2017/09/27/us/politics/six-charts-to-explain-the-republican-tax-plan.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Source: New York Times</a>; proposed deductions would increase with inflation in 2018.</em></small></p>
                <p>If you are single, then the proposed plan will nearly double the standard deduction allowed, and eliminate the personal exemption (which is based on the number of taxpayers and the dependents claimed on a return).</p>
                <p>Other changes proposed include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Most filers will be able to claim a higher single deduction under the proposed plan, with the exception of those claiming multiple children. There is a chance that the higher child tax credit and additional non-child dependent credit proposed can make up for the difference.</li>
                <li>You can choose the standard deduction or itemized deductions but not both. According to the New York Times, 70% of filers currently choose the standard deduction because it’s higher than what they qualify for in itemized ones.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>So what about itemized deductions? Most of them &#8211; including those used for state and local tax expenses &#8211; would be eliminated. The plan, however, proposed to keep the deductions for mortgage interest expenses and charitable giving, as well as the incentives for education and retirement savings plans.</p>
                <h2>What Else Will Change?</li>
                </h2>
                <p>The proposed plan aims to reduce the corporate tax rate 10% to 20% (down from 35%) with the hopes of making American companies more competitive with other global companies. Also in the world of business and taxes &#8211; “pass-through businesses” (e.g. partnership, S corporations and sole proprietorships) would have a new tax rate of 25%. </p>
                <p>However, some of the more complex business tax issues remain to be worked out, such as the possibility that wealthy individuals could take advantage of this lower tax rate by incorporating as a pass-through business. </p>
                <h2>Our Take</h2>
                <p>It’s important to note that the proposed tax changes currently being discussed are from the House version of the bill. The Senate version has not yet been released and there will likely be significant changes before a bill is passed.</p>
                <p>As of right now, it appears that there will be broad tax cuts that will have a positive impact on many taxpayers. The Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) is on the chopping block and some households could potentially save quite a few dollars if that tax is repealed.</p>
                <p>While it’s always interesting to watch the negotiations unfold and figure out how they might impact your own life – for better or for worse- we encourage you to avoid making any significant changes to your tax management strategies before the new legislation passes. If/when the proposal is signed into law, you’ll then be able to adjust your strategies accordingly.<br />

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>This week, we learned the pick for the new Fed chairman and saw the details of the House GOP tax plan. Markets continued their nonchalant attitude and moved modestly higher on low volatility. If confirmed by the Senate, Federal Reserve Governor Jerome Powell will be the 16th chairperson of the central bank. He is widely expected to maintain Janet Yellen’s approach of gradual rate hikes and a measured approach to reducing the Fed’s balance sheet. In corporate earnings news, Apple exceeded expectations on predicted strong sales of its iPhone X, while Tesla announced supply chain difficulties and reduced expectations for deliveries of its key Model 3.  </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,588 (+0.3%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.8%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.33% (-0.09%)<br />
                Gold: $1,270 (-0.2%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.161 (+0.0)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:    </strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Monday – Lennar agreed to buy CalAtlantic group, creating the largest U.S. homebuilder</li>
                <li>Tuesday – Members of the U.S. International Trade Commission recommended tariffs on solar panels to protect U.S. producers</li>
                <li>Tuesday – CME Group said it aims to launch a futures contract on Bitcoin by the end of the year – a move that would make it easier for institutional investors to access the currency</li>
                <li>Wednesday – The Fed left interest rates unchanged and said the economy has been growing at a solid rate despite the hurricanes</li>
                <li>Wednesday – Facebook reported a 79% jump in earnings, but the stock reaction was muted as the company said it would dramatically increase spending on security</li>
                <li>Wednesday – The White House indicated it would nominate Fed Governor Jerome Powell as the next Chairman of the Federal Reserve</li>
                <li>Thursday – Apple said earnings rose 19% and indicated strong demand in China and for its iPhoneX. The stock briefly passed $900 billion in market cap</li>
                <li>Thursday – Starbucks lowered its long-term growth forecast and said it would sell its Tazo tea brand to focus on Teavana</li>
                <li>Friday – Hiring rebounded in October and the unemployment rate fell to 4.1%, a 17-year low</li>
                <li>Friday – Broadcom was said to be planning a takeover of Qualcomm, which is currently valued at $90 billion</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Our Take</strong><br />
                The House’s Ways and Means Committee previewed its proposed tax bill this week. It is important to remember this was just the House version and it will likely change significantly before passage, if it passes at all. That said, a few things stood out to us. In the proposed plan, the corporate tax rate drops to 20%, which would appease the market &#8211;  which seems to be expecting at least some corporate tax cut. Also, unlike previous plan descriptions, there appears to be a legitimate, broad tax cut for the middle class (unless you live in a high state tax state). Because it lowers the 15% bracket to 12%, raises the income range for that bracket to $90,000 for married couples, and increases the standard deduction, this would be especially beneficial to retired people who have meaningful RMDs but no real earned income. </p>
                <p>The bill would also impact the decision on going with a Roth vs. Traditional account, but in which direction would be a case-by-case situation. It makes Roth accounts more or less attractive because current taxes will be lower for most, but less attractive because tax rates would also be lower in retirement for most. As always, it largely depends if you believe tax rates will go back up in the future. </p>
                <p>This proposed bill would also increase the deficit even further, which suggests taxes should go back up in the future, but people have believed that for a long time and the trend has remained for lower rates. There are still a lot of details to work out around state tax deduction, AMT, mortgage interest, and so on. There will be new news before the end of the year, so it probably doesn’t make sense to change tax strategy quite yet – but it’s certainly getting more interesting.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>As Halloween approaches tomorrow, we reminisce on our childhood fears of ghosts and goblins. However, as adults we develop new fears &#8212; specifically about our financial futures. </p>
                <p>According to a recent <a href="https://www.allianzlife.com/about/news-and-events/news-releases/Generations-Ahead-Study-2017" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Allianz poll</a>, out of 3,000 people, nearly two-thirds fear running out of money in retirement over meeting the Grim Reaper. With October being National Financial Planning Month, now is a good time to ensure your nest egg is big enough to support you through your golden years.</p>
                <p>First, ask yourself two questions:</p>
                <p><strong>1. Are you saving for retirement?</strong></p>
                <p>If yes, that’s a great start!<br />
                <strong><br />
                2. Are you planning for retirement?</strong></p>
                <p>If the answer is no, below are a few reasons why you might want to start.</p>
                <h2>Just Saving Is Not Enough</h2>
                <p>Due to extremely low interest rates, if you have money just sitting in a savings account, it typically doesn’t grow very much. In some cases, due to inflation, those dollars may not even grow enough to support you in retirement, leaving you at a long-term financial disadvantage. </p>
                <p>The good news is very few Americans retire on their savings alone. Most people invest some of their savings and will retire on the accumulated earnings their investments generate over time.</p>
                <h2>Investing Without Planning is a Crapshoot</h2>
                <p>Generally, people invest with the ultimate goal of building wealth, particularly for retirement. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/29/one-third-of-americans-lack-a-future-financial-plan-study.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">But too many Americans invest without a fleshed-out plan</a>. Without a plan, you can only guess how much money you will need in retirement &#8212; and chances are, that guess is off.</p>
                <p>A good financial plan is created with the help of an<a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" rel="noopener" target="_blank"> experienced financial professional</a>, who can help you address priorities &#8212; such as managing risk and deferring or reducing your taxes &#8212; while defining your personalized investment approach. A financial plan is constantly evolving as it should change over time to reflect the changes in your life and financial objectives.</p>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>Don’t be spooked by the ghosts of your financial past. Halloween is a time full of freights and terrors, but your financial plan doesn’t have to be one of them. Even though October is drawing to a close, there’s no time like the present to get your long-term goals on track. The new year is approaching faster than we think and it’s important to contemplate the things we’ve done in the past and what we want to do in the future. </p>
                <p>Personal Capital’s tools like the <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/retirement-planner" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Retirement Planner</a> are great places to start building a plan. With these tools you can set short-term and long-term financial goals and create benchmarks allowing you to see the distance between where you are now and where you need to be financially. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>It was a somewhat bumpy week for U.S. stocks with corporate earnings driving most of the swings. Tuesday’s positive results from Caterpillar and 3M led equities higher, but a string of negative surprises on Wednesday wiped out gains. Markets then sharply rebounded Friday on the back of strong results from industry giants Google, Amazon, Microsoft and Intel. Foreign stocks mostly followed suit, but were unable to end the week in positive territory. U.S. bond yields moved higher while the dollar strengthened against the euro. </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,581 (+0.2)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (-0.2%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.42% (+0.03%)<br />
                Gold: $1,273 (-0.5%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.161 (-1.5%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:    </strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> &#8211; Tesla struck a deal with China to build a new manufacturing facility in Shanghai, a move intended to capitalize on China’s fast-growing EV market.</li>
                <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> &#8211; Bellwethers Caterpillar and 3M both reported stronger than expected quarterly results.</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> &#8211; A string of disappointing earnings from the likes of Chipotle, Boeing and AT&#038;T sent U.S. equities lower. </li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> &#8211; The ECB announced its plan to extend, yet reduce bond purchases over the coming year.</li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> &#8211; U.S. GDP grew at a 3% annual rate in the third quarter, ahead of most estimates.</li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> &#8211; The technology sector notched additional gains following upbeat results from Google, Microsoft and Intel. While not officially considered part of the tech sector, Amazon also posted strong quarterly growth. </li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Our take: </strong><br />
                Slow as we go&#8230;</p>
                <p>On Thursday, the European Central Bank (ECB) revealed plans regarding the future of its bond buying program. It was a highly anticipated announcement as many around the world look for clues as to when quantitative easing will finally come to an end in Europe. </p>
                <p>As it turns out, the party will continue for a while longer—the music will just be turned down a tad.  The ECB plans to keep buying bonds until at least September of 2018, but will cut its monthly purchases in half starting in January. The central bank also left open the possibility of continuing past September should the situation call for it. </p>
                <p>So at the end of the day there appears to be no imminent risk of the ECB raising rates, at least in the near-term. Instead, it will be a slow and measured process. This was more or less in line with expectations with perhaps a slightly more dovish tone, and it was enough to placate markets. Only time will tell whether this extended period of stimulus will be a good thing, but at least they planted the seed for future tightening without sparking another taper tantrum. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paying your financial advisor an annual fee of two to three percent seems harmless. However, that seemingly small difference could crush your portfolio. Compounded over a lifetime, those percentages can add up to hundreds of thousands of dollars &#8212; potentially more than $400,000 according to our latest report &#8220;<a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/report-what-americans-pay-in-advisory-fees" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Hidden Beneath the Surface: What You Might Be Losing to Hidden Fees</a>.&#8221; That’s your money that should have been available to you for financing your children’s education, purchasing that second home or enjoying retirement, but instead went into the pockets of a financial advisor or product seller.</p>
                <p>Many Americans don’t understand how much they pay their financial advisors – and it isn’t their fault. It&#8217;s quite common to find advisory fees and expense ratios explained with industry jargon that is nearly impossible to decipher or hidden in the fine print &#8211; and then tracing them through your account is another feat altogether. Fees vary greatly not only across different firms, but even within the same organization—and ignoring these differences can be extremely costly. But, it’s not just about the fees, but what you get for them. In the report, we analyzed ten leading advisory firms (Ameriprise, UBS, Morgan Stanley, Edward Jones, Well Fargo, Merrill Lynch, JP Morgan, Charles Schwab, Vanguard and Personal Capital) to determine their associated fees.</p>
                <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46898" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advisor_fee_report-estimated-fees-by-institution.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advisor_fee_report-estimated-fees-by-institution.jpg 1322w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advisor_fee_report-estimated-fees-by-institution-248x300.jpg 248w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advisor_fee_report-estimated-fees-by-institution-768x930.jpg 768w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advisor_fee_report-estimated-fees-by-institution-393x476.jpg 393w" sizes="(max-width: 1322px) 100vw, 1322px" />
                <p>Just as importantly, we share three key lessons for any investor to consider:</p>
                <h4>1. Identifying Fees is Hard</h4>
                <p>Could you easily and quickly answer what fees, expenses and charges you pay to your financial advisor? If the answer is no, you’re not alone. You might think you’re only paying around 1% in management fees, but truth is, the additional hidden fees you’re paying would make a loan shark blush. What’s more, you’ll probably be digging through pages of obscure terminology to find the fee information you actually want. If you don’t have a laundry list of every single fee your advisor imposes, demand one.</p>
                <h4>2. Hidden Fees are Often Siphoning Your Returns</h4>
                <p>Perhaps some financial advisors might be worth the generous fees they charge if they’re able to help their clients achieve their goals. But, for someone who is maxing out their 401k every year of their working career (21 to 65 years old) the total average additional amount lost to fees (1% to 3%) adds up to more than $400,000 over the course of a lifetime – higher than the median price of a home in the United States. Even a 1% difference (i.e. 2% vs. 1%) costs the investor an extra $240,000 in fees over that time horizon. Even worse, that doesn’t fully capture the amount the investor loses in total returns. Because fees are charged along the way, that money doesn’t have time to grow and compound. Using all of the above assumptions, the total amount an investor loses at a 3% fee vs. a 1% fee – including both fees and foregone returns – is more than $740,000 during their lifetime.</p>
                <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-46896" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advisor_fee_report-account-growth.jpg" alt="" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advisor_fee_report-account-growth.jpg 918w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advisor_fee_report-account-growth-300x201.jpg 300w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advisor_fee_report-account-growth-768x514.jpg 768w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/advisor_fee_report-account-growth-712x476.jpg 712w" sizes="(max-width: 918px) 100vw, 918px" />
                <h4>3. Consider the Value of Wealth Management vs. Fees You Pay</h4>
                <p>Humans have a tendency to believe that in life, you get what you pay for. For example, a Michelin-rated restaurant costs a lot more than the food truck outside your office. In March,<a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/assets/email/2017-Personal-Capital-Financial-Trust-Report.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> we issued a poll</a> that discovered 32% of people believe higher fees for investment accounts results in higher returns. While this is sometimes the case, it’s important to look at the whole picture when selecting a wealth management solution. When you go car shopping, you don’t choose a car solely based on gas mileage, you evaluate the car and all of its features in their entirety. Similarly to choosing a financial advisor, you want to select a firm that offers a holistic wealth management and financial planning service. At Personal Capital, we set out to help investors with complex financial needs, or those who want advice that goes beyond answering a couple simple questions to make a few simple mutual fund recommendations. There can be tremendous value in comprehensive financial planning by a fiduciary informed by sophisticated and dynamically updated digital tools. If done correctly, services like tax optimization, rebalancing, and estate planning can add value far beyond the service cost.</p>
                <h2>A Wealth Management Solution That Works</h2>
                <p>Managing financial accounts today is much easier than it used to be. Consumers have easy access to financial tools that help them become better investors. With Personal Capital’s <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank" rel="noopener">free app and dashboard</a>, you can use tools like our Fee Analyzer to discover the impact of hidden fees on your retirement savings. Our Investment Checkup tool allows you to see how well your investments are performing and how they could do even better.</p>
                <p>Bottom line: It’s important to understand the range of investment fees you could be paying, the total level of fees charged by various firms, how fees impact portfolio returns over time, and what value or additional services to expect for certain fees. If the industry isn’t going to embrace full transparency, then it’s up to consumers to empower themselves by using technology and asking the right questions. Do your due diligence and make sure you fully understand what the potential associated costs are with your account. A good starting point is asking a financial advisor <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/financial-planning-2/going-beyond-the-fiduciary-rule-to-protect-investors/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">these three questions</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this video series, our Investment Committee discusses Q3 market returns, what to watch for with pending tax reform, how to protect yourself in the wake of the Equifax data breach, a special message to those affected by natural disasters, and what’s new at Personal Capital.</p>

                <iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PL9Dk6Lt6mOuUGrnSxEm86LH33GuJZ0oEc&#038;rel=0&#038;autohide=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
                </div>
                <h2>TOPIC 1: Q3 MARKET RECAP</h2>
                <p>The third quarter was an eventful one when you consider all that happened in the world. North Korea successfully tested a hydrogen bomb, devastating hurricanes battered the United States and Puerto Rico, Equifax suffered a major data breach, and the White House feuded with the NFL. Through it all, however, the bull market remained unfazed, with stocks marching to new highs. Stocks rose for the 8th quarter in a row, returning about 4.5% in the US. International stocks did even better, gaining nearly 6% for the quarter.</p>
                <p>The third quarter was a good reminder of how to think about markets. Stock prices are always a function of supply and demand or basic economics. They are not a measure of geopolitical temperament or the general state of the world. That distinction can be hard to grasp, especially because dramatic events are thrust in our faces on a daily basis. But the fact is, stocks don’t care about non-economic world events or human drama—they often rise through extended periods of uncertainty and global tension, and they just as often fall when people feel the most optimistic, as we saw in 2000. The key lesson for investors is to not let emotions disrupt a sound investment strategy. Those who have stuck with a personalized, strategic asset allocation have benefited greatly from this bull market. They can feel confident knowing they are appropriately diversified for the full market cycle.</p>

                <h2>TOPIC 2: WHAT’S NEW AT PERSONAL CAPITAL</h2>
                <p>The third quarter was an exciting one for us here at Personal Capital. During the quarter, we officially passed $5 billion in total assets under management. We now manage money for more than 13,000 families, and more than 1.5 million households use our tools to track their financial lives. We’re of course very proud of all those numbers, but the number we’re most proud of is our client retention. More than 95% of all Personal Capital clients choose to stay with us year after year, which means more to us than any other accomplishment. We’re so glad that so many of you recognize the value in our services, and we remain committed to helping each and every one of our clients achieve their personal financial goals.</p>
                <p>In that vein, we also released a few additional tools this quarter that improve on our already great dashboard, and provide you with even greater insight into your financial plan. On the web, we implemented our Personal Strategy feature, which allows you to drill down into trading activity and dividends received. Within our Retirement Planner, we released an education planner to help you track and prepare for college costs. In the tool, you can look up the expected costs of specific colleges, determine annual savings goals, and track progress. Best of all, the education planner is fully integrated with your retirement plan, so you can create multiple income or spending scenarios and see their immediate impact on your overall portfolio and retirement plan.</p>

                <h2>TOPIC 3: NATURAL DISASTERS</h2>
                <p>In this video series, we wanted to take a brief moment to acknowledge everyone who was affected by one of the seemingly never-ending natural disasters this quarter.  From hurricanes in Texas and Florida, to the current wildfires raging in California, this has been an incredibly difficult period for many people. We mentioned in an earlier section that natural disasters almost never have any impact on stock prices, nor have they this time. However, while we are dispassionate about these kinds of tragedies when it comes to assessing market effect, we are heartbroken when considering the human impact. Our hearts go out to all of you who were affected, or are still being affected, by one of these tragedies. This issue is especially close to our employees in California, many of whom have family or friends who have lost everything in the current fires. If you have any questions, special needs, or changes to your financial situation as a result of one of these disasters, please do not hesitate to contact us. In the meantime, our thoughts are with all of you for a safe and speedy recovery.</p>

                </div>
                <h2>TOPIC 4: EQUIFAX</h2>
                <p>I’m aggrieved to have to talk about this, but I do. Equifax is a recent break, exposing or potentially compromising 140 million families personal and sensitive information. It is irresponsible and unforgivable. Their job is to not only collect, but protect, that data and they haven’t. Ok, what can you do about it? Well, first you can put security freezes on your accounts at Equifax and the other credit reporting agencies and we recommend that you do. But in addition, Personal Capital’s dashboard can be an incredibly valuable protection. There are things you need to do in order to prevent problems, but then there are also things you can do to monitor and then manage problems if they do appear. The dashboard, which can give you instant access to all of your financial accounts at all financial institutions is the best way to make sure that if anything goes awry, you know about it quickly and you can shut it down and ameliorate the issue. So please, make use of our free software to help protect your family’s money. </p>

                </div>
                <h2>TOPIC 5: TAXES</h2>
                <p>Nearly a year into President Trump’s term, there is no wall being built and the Affordable Care Act remains intact. But we expect President Trump and the GOP will make their best effort to enact some tax reform. The next several months will probably be the last, best shot to pass meaningful legislation.</p>
                <p>Everything related to taxes is complicated, but the basic point of the proposals being discussed is to lower taxes for corporations and very wealthy individuals. The latest proposal includes details related to elimination of AMT, fewer tax brackets, changes to the standard deduction and personal exemptions, estate tax repeal, and lower corporate tax rates. There is much more, as well, but at this stage we don’t think you should spend much time planning for reforms that may or may not occur. That said, here are a few things you might consider now.</p>
                <ol>
                <li>If you have high property tax bills and have the option to do so, you may consider accelerating payments into 2017.</li>
                <li>If you have incentive stock options that are priced above grant, you may consider waiting to exercise.</li>
                <li>If you are looking at an insurance product to reduce possible estate taxes, you may want to wait and see what happens to the estate tax.</li>
                <li>Existing tax management investment techniques, such as loss harvesting and tax allocation, remain valuable and should be incorporated in your strategy.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>We aren’t tax attorneys, and much of what is to happen with these reforms is yet to unfold. So, be sure to check with your tax professional before taking any action.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Markets remained calm as corporate earnings satisfied investors and controversial actions from the White House surrounding Obamacare and Iran were largely ignored by investors. The situation around the Catalonia region declaring independence remains fierce but some indications of willingness to work with the central government helped the Euro. </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,553 (+0.2%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+1.8%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.27% (-0.10%)<br />
                Gold: $1,275 (-0.4%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.182 (+0.8%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:    </strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> – GE said it would give activist Trian Fund Management a seat on its board.</li>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> – The Trump administration said it would withdraw carbon emission limits currently imposed on power plants.</li>
                <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> – GM acquired Strobe, in an effort to bolster its position in the self-driving car race.</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – President Trump signed an executive order to end cost-sharing subsidies to insurers. </li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – AT&#038;T said it lost 90,000 TV subscribers as more people turn to streaming.</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Increased credit card lending and cost-cutting allowed Citigroup and JP Morgan to grow earnings by 7.6% and 7.1% respectively.</li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – President Trump said he won’t certify if Iran is complying with the 2015 nuclear accord agreement and called the country a “rogue regime”.</li>
                <li>
                <strong>Friday</strong> – Saudi Arabia said it is considering abandoning plans for an international IPO of state-owned Saudi Aramco.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Takeaway:</h2>
                <p>The S&#038;P 500 didn’t move more than 0.25% on a single day this week. The VIX, a popular measure of expected volatility closed at 9.6, the lowest level in at least 10 years except for a brief period in July and also earlier this month. This type of calm is nice – especially when there are lots more small up days than down days. It is also interesting. There are plenty of things in the world that could, and usually would cause volatility, but markets just don’t seem interested. </p>
                <p>Some attribute the phenomenon to the rise of ETFs and passive investing. It could be that more investors are finally buying into the concept of long-term strategies but we don’t see much reason why an increase in index funds would lower overall market volatility. If anything, theoretical lower active volume on individual stocks would make them more volatile. </p>
                <p>It is easy to say low volatility will likely pass soon. And investors should be prepared for that, but the truth is no one knows. The risk is becoming complacent and making bets that could be too risky if volatility does return. We believe those writing options, using leverage or who simply making a general asset allocation plan would be well served to model risk based on longer-term historical volatility assumptions rather than data from the last few years.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Over the past quarter, North Korea successfully tested a hydrogen bomb; devastating hurricanes battered Texas, Florida and the Caribbean; political dysfunction in Washington featured more Russia controversy and significant White House staff turnover; Equifax reported a massive personal data breach; and the Fed indicated it remains on track to raise interest rates another 0.25% this year while beginning the process of deleveraging its massive balance sheet. Yet through it all, the bull market remained unfazed. </p>
                <h2>Market Recap &#038; Capital Markets Outlook</h2>
                <p>US stocks rose for an 8th consecutive quarter, and daily volatility stayed conspicuously absent. The US Total Stock market returned 4.5% for the quarter. Globally diversified investors fared better, as international stocks outperformed the US for a third straight quarter by gaining 5.9%. S&#038;P 500 earnings growth for Q3 is estimated at 5%, according to FactSet. This is respectable, but means the majority of gains in US Stocks over the last year came from PE multiple expansion rather than earnings growth. Q2 US GDP growth was revised up to a healthy 3.1%.</p>
                <p>Ten years ago this week, the global stock market peaked. It then slowly declined for about a year before the crescendo of the Lehman bankruptcy and near collapse of the financial system. The nine-year-old bull market added another solid quarter to the history books in Q3. There may be new scary headlines across the news, but the fundamental backdrop for capital markets hasn’t significantly changed. Valuations remain elevated &#8211; but not extreme. Economic growth and corporate earnings are solid &#8211; but not exciting. Meanwhile, major central banks including the Fed have taken their foot off the gas and are contemplating periodic light taps on the brakes. </p>
                <h2>Equifax Breach</h2>
                <p>News of a significant data breach at Equifax affected an estimated 143 million U.S. consumers. While this is not the largest breach of recent times, it may very well be the most damaging to American families due to the nature of the data that is now in the hands of cybercriminals. Our Chief Security Officer, Maxime Rousseau, shared his tips for staying safe from any potential hacks including: signing up for free monitoring, freezing and monitoring your credit file actively, keeping a close eye on your financial accounts, and complying with the latest password security standards.</p>
                <h2>Tax Reform</h2>
                <p>There is no wall being built and the Affordable Care Act remains intact nearly a year into President Trump’s term. But we expect President Trump and the GOP will make their best effort to enact some tax reform. The next several months will probably be the last, best shot to pass meaningful legislation such as the proposed elimination of AMT (alternative minimum tax), reduction in the number of tax brackets, plan to double the standard deduction to $24,000 for married couples, tax code deduction of mortgage interest, estate tax repeal, lower rate on pass-through businesses and lower corporate tax rate.</p>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>While uncertainty ravages the globe and a current bull market will only last so long, diversification is the best tool available to manage risk while maintaining upside potential. A portfolio’s total allocation to stocks is the biggest driver of both return and risk, but diversification within stocks also remains important. The US has dominated most of this bull market, but international stocks have a healthy lead this year and we wouldn’t be surprised if the tide has shifted. A good mix of both is the best approach. At the sector level, it is important to remember what goes up the most often goes down the most. It is fine to have healthy exposure to trendy technology stocks, but it can be risky to ignore other sectors.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Like most people, you’ve probably wondered, “How much income will I need during my retirement years?”. You’ve also probably wondered why you never seem to run across an answer to that ubiquitous question. So how much do you need to ensure you can retire comfortably?</p>
                <h2>Why the Answer is Hard to Find</h2>
                <p>There is endless information about building a retirement nest egg and almost nothing about how big that nest egg should be. Two common reasons why the size of your nest egg is the subject of endless debate include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>The amount is different for everyone because a “comfortable” retirement is entirely subjective</li>
                <li>No one can agree on how much of your nest egg you can spend each year to sustain a comfortable retirement</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As an individual, the first reason is straightforward and can be answered relatively easily. On your own, or with the help of a financial advisor, you can develop an estimate with some back-of-the envelope math. </p>
                <h2>What to Consider When Determining Your Retirement</h2>
                <p>First you must decide what you consider a “comfortable” retirement. This answer is, of course, different for everyone. But with a little addition and some simple multiplication, you now have a reasonably accurate estimate of your required annual income needs in retirement.<br />
                Some basic things to consider when calculating how much you need for retirement include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Basic Needs</strong>: If you want a basic income to cover those needs, then you should identify your monthly necessities and multiply by 12. These items include: mortgage, groceries, insurance, utilities, car payments, and other expenses.</li>
                <li><strong>Added Luxuries</strong>: If you want more luxuries, you should define the specific desired activities and estimate their approximate costs based on frequency, equipment needed, or any other related. These costs should be added to your monthly budget. Examples of these luxuries can include hobbies, a vacation home, a boat, and travel.</li>
                <li><strong>Inflation</strong>: Additionally, you’ll need to consider inflation. There is plenty of information available to help establish a reasonable inflation estimate, but 3-4% is a good long-term inflation number you can use for your calculations.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>The Challenges of Predicting the Future</h2>
                <p>There is more to retirement planning; however, it’s not often so easy to calculate. To decide how much you can spend each year to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/retirement-planning/how-to-build-sustain-the-retirement-lifestyle-you-want/">sustain your retirement</a>, you need to know how long you will live in retirement and how much your investment portfolio will earn. If you retire at 65 and die at 80, you’ll need income for 15 years. What happens if you live to be 100? You don’t want to live without resources for 20 years. So, how much will your investment portfolio earn? That depends on stock market/economic conditions and the asset mix in your portfolio. You’ll also need to consider other individualized factors, such as how long you will work, social security, pensions, home equity and, of course, financial market cycles during your retirement years.<br />
                Now you can see why the “how-much” question generates endless debate. How long you will live and how much your portfolio will earn are simply unanswerable questions. </p>
                <h2>The “4% Rule”</h2>
                <p>For more than 20 years, financial professionals have been loosely guided by what is called the 4% rule. If you follow this rule, you withdraw 4% of your portfolio in the first year of retirement and then you annually withdraw that same dollar amount, adjusted for inflation, for the next 30 years. The idea is that if you follow this rule, you minimize your chances of running out of money in retirement.</p>
                <p>While this rule is a good starting point, it has been hotly debated since it was established. Some argue that it is too conservative. Others argue that today’s low-interest environment and longer life expectancies make it too risky. Meanwhile, your financial future hangs in the balance. If the rule is too conservative, then you’ve unnecessarily constrained your retirement lifestyle. If the rule is too risky, you could run out of money just when you need it most.</p>
                <h2>The Definitive Answer to an Indefinable Problem</h2>
                <p>While the debate rages on, there is a one-word answer to this how-much question: flexibility.<br />
                And while it would be convenient to have a magic number to shoot for, that number is going to fluctuate constantly throughout your life based on a multitude of factors. So, the best answer is to maintain your flexibility—beginning when you are young by ensuring the decisions you make allow you to have more flexibility when you are in retirement. Review your retirement annually, consult with your financial advisor, ask questions, and be open to changes based on both individual and outside factors. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Sometimes life goes as planned, and sometimes it throws us curveballs. Whether expected or unexpected, certain events have a large effect on our financial lives. So, this week, we’ve added a new feature to Personal Capital’s <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Web Dashboard</a> to prepare you for anything that may lay ahead.</p>
                <p>Our new planning features take the guesswork out of financial decisions by allowing you to create multiple income or spending scenarios. You can immediately see the impact of hypothetical income events like inheritance, the sale of a home, or going back to work after retirement. Similarly, you can input expenses like travel, a child’s wedding, home renovation, or making a charitable donation. Maybe you or a spouse want to take a year off or stop working entirely. What impact would this have on when you can retire, or how much you save? Our new scenario and comparison tools allow you to plan for multiple potential outcomes. Best of all, you can save different scenarios and compare the impact of various decisions versus your current financial plan.</p>
                <p>This feature works together with our newly launched &#8216;Education Planning&#8217; tool, which helps you understand and compare the costs of a specific college or overall in-state vs out-of-state college costs, as well as determine your annual savings needs while you track your progress. Forty percent of college students take a fifth year to graduate, and you can model what impact that would have on your annual spending. You can also see how hypothetical changes to education goals impact your overall portfolio and retirement readiness.</p>
                <h2>How it Works</h2>
                <h3>Step 1:</h3>
                <p>Sign in to your Personal Capital account and select ‘Retirement Planner’ under the ‘Planning’ tab in the header menu.</p>
                <img class="alignnone wp-image-46852 size-full" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-10.png" alt="" width="912" height="192" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-10.png 912w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-10-300x63.png 300w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-10-768x162.png 768w" sizes="(max-width: 912px) 100vw, 912px" />
                <h3>Step 2:</h3>
                <p>In the Retirement Planner, select the ‘+’ next to Spending Goals, and select the ‘Education’ icon.</p>
                <img class="alignnone wp-image-46853 size-full" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-8.png" alt="" width="1050" height="579" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-8.png 1050w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-8-300x165.png 300w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-8-768x423.png 768w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-8-863x476.png 863w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" />
                <h3>Step 3:</h3>
                <p>Create a ‘New Education Goal&#8217;. Select or add your student, their birth year and their education type – private school (pre-college) or higher education.</p>
                <img class="alignnone wp-image-46854 size-full" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-7.png" alt="" width="1050" height="568" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-7.png 1050w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-7-300x162.png 300w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-7-768x415.png 768w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-7-880x476.png 880w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" />

                <h3>Step 4:</h3>
                <p>Add in any and all savings toward this goal by linking any current associated accounts or you can manually enter the amount. However, we encourage you to link any existing accounts so you can designate all or a portion of those given accounts toward an education goal. This allows you to monitor your progress and contributions and helps you keep on track for hitting your goals. Our Average costs calculator – which includes tuition, room and board, and books – will help you determine an appropriate amount to save.</p>

                <p>Our planner accounts for inflation by deflating future returns on your college savings to today’s dollars for an easier comparison with today’s college costs, to help you most accurately compare.</p>
                <h3>Step 5:</h3>
                <p>Our planner helps you calculate how much you need to save per month or per year, from now to the time your student starts college. Personal Capital recommends saving for 70% of the total costs.</p>

                <img class="alignnone wp-image-46859 size-full" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.png" alt="" width="1050" height="580" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2.png 1050w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2-300x166.png 300w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2-768x424.png 768w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-2-862x476.png 862w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" />
                <h3>Step 6:</h3>
                <p>Select ‘Done’ and you now have your final education analysis. You can see your projections and edit contributions, select specific schools to see how your savings will net out, and see your “Fund-it-all” amount and your projected tax savings from a 529 plan.</p>
                <img class="alignnone wp-image-46861 size-full" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-12.png" alt="" width="1050" height="575" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-12.png 1050w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-12-300x164.png 300w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-12-768x421.png 768w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/unnamed-12-869x476.png 869w" sizes="(max-width: 1050px) 100vw, 1050px" />
                <h3>Step 7:</h3>
                <p>You can now complete your final analysis. For example, you can save it as a new scenario such as, “Katie goes to Stanford” under ‘Retirement Planner’ and see how it affects your retirement readiness and your overall financial plan. This is how you can compare all different types of scenarios (home-buying, inheritance, etc) and see how it impacts your plan.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Stocks continued to rise in the face of a horrific mass-shooting and escalating geopolitical tension. The US economy shed 33,000 jobs in September, but it was largely due to the hurricanes and the overall market remains strong. Unemployment dropped to 4.2%. Earnings season got underway with investors seemingly optimistic about exceeding a 5% expected growth rate. Tensions in Spain rose over the issue of Catalan succession, which pressured the Euro.</p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,549 (+1.2%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.4%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.37% (+0.12%)<br />
                Gold: $1,275 (-0.4%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.173 (-0.7%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:</strong>    </p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> – Goldman Sachs was said to be preparing a trading operation dedicated to Bitcoin and other digital currencies.</li>
                <li>
                <strong>Monday</strong> – Tesla said it built 260 Model 3s in the third quarter, missing its target of 1500.</li>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> – A gauge US manufacturing activity reached a 13 year high in September.</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – Puerto Rican bonds fell after President Trump suggested bondholders may not be paid back.</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – The CFPB passed rules limiting payday lenders, but it will face challenges.  </li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Boeing acquired Aurora Flight Sciences, in a possible move toward flying cars or taxis.</li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – The September jobs report was strong in light of the hurricanes and unemployment dropped to 4.2%.</li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – The White House launched a program to explore reducing the use of Social Security numbers in the wake of the Equifax scandal.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>With all the troubling events of the past two months, sometimes it is nice to focus on something aspirational and fun. This week, Boeing bought Aurora Flight Sciences. Developments may end up being military in nature, but many believe the intent is trying to accelerate more widespread aviation for consumers. </p>
                <p>People have been talking about flying cars for decades and in reality, the image of the Jetsons is still decades away. But Uber and others are seriously working on solving this and there are already videos of one-man flying machines that are quite exciting (though for now, they are riding over water just in case). </p>
                <p>We are nine years deep into a bull market. A nice thing about long bull markets is they give companies money to spend on innovation and things that won’t be profitable for some time to come. Driverless cars are also still years away but those with younger kids can be hopeful they will greatly improve safety.</p>
                <p>The huge market capitalization numbers of companies like Uber, Google and Boeing will allow for more and faster innovation. If the bull market lasts at least few more years we could get more interesting stuff faster than we imagined on the consumer and health care front. And that would be worth celebrating.  </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Situation</h2>
                <p>Sam and Bailey are married with three young children. The couple, who are both doctors in their mid-30s, live in Colorado which is one of the handful of states that offers a generous unlimited state income tax deduction for 529 contributions. Because they are successful in their fields and spend frugally, Sam and Bailey have a significant ability to save each year.</p>
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>The couple wants to provide for four years of college for each of their three children, with expected costs of $40,000 per child, per year – totaling $480,000. They know the importance of saving for retirement and need to figure out how to put away nearly half a million dollars to support their educational goals without sacrificing their future retirement.</p>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>After reviewing Sam and Bailey’s financial goals, their advisor found their local 529 plan offered an income tax deduction. He recommended they use the in-state plan to reap the tax benefits since plan assets grow tax free, so long as the funds are used for qualified higher education expenses. In addition, because of the couple’s ability to save large dollar amounts annually, their advisor discussed ‘front-loading’ the 529 plans, which gave the family more potential to achieve longer-term growth in those tax-advantaged accounts. ‘Front-Loading’ is putting an upfront lump sum amount into a 529, which can give Sam and Bailey potential for growth over the longest period of time possible(remember any growth in a 529 is tax free if used for qualified expenses). ‘Front-Loading’ also provided Sam and Bailey with peace of mind about college funding goals.</p>
                <p>One balance they were careful to strike was the percentage of expected higher education costs to cover directly from the 529 assets. While fully funding a 529 account for the youngest child left more time for the account to grow, it also increased the danger of overfunding the account, which risks leaving unused funds in the account. Their advisor also asked them to consider the impact of significantly contributing to 529 plans, in a situation where one or more of their children might not end up attending college (thereby having a fully funded 529 that would not be used for its original purpose). </p>
                <p>In the end, Sam and Bailey felt there was a strong chance their children would attend college, and they could absorb the cost of funding a 529 plan without sacrificing their own retirement. They decided to fund each child’s 529 account with enough money to cover 75% of the expected costs, after assumed growth. The remaining 25% of college costs were expected to be covered from Bailey and Sam’s cash flows, or through small student loans that the children would be expected to take on (for some ‘skin in the game’). </p>
                <h2>The Results</h2>
                <p>Sam and Bailey funded each of three children’s accounts with enough money to expect – according to all the assumptions they made with their financial advisor – the appropriate amount of growth to cover the majority of each child’s expected college expenses. When their children are 18, the majority of their educational costs should be covered by the 529 plan. Sam and Bailey adhered to the adage that borrowing for college is always an option, but borrowing for retirement is not, and they’ve since checked in on the growth of each account at least on an annual basis with their advisor.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>The Dow, S&#038;P, and Nasdaq all closed at all-time highs to end the quarter, with the Dow having 8 straight quarters of positive returns.  Crude oil futures were up after weekly oil rig counts rose and the markets have reacted positively to the new GOP tax plan this week.  Global stock markets have also gained as economic growth around the world has been solid.  </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,519.36 (+.69%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+.20%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.25% (.00%)<br />
                Gold: $1,280 (-1.3%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.181 (-1.7%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:</strong>    </p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> – GE Agrees to Sell Industrial Unit to ABB for $2.6 Billion</li>
                <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> – Case Shiller Index releases Top 20 city Composite which posted a 5.8% year over year gain.  </li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – Trump Administration releases broad outline for Tax reform  </li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Roku IPO Shares Surge in trading debut</li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – Elon Musk announces Hypersonic Space Rocket Airline </ul>
                </li>
                <h2>Our Takeaway:</h2>
                <p>The Trump administration released the tax reform outline. While the summary does answer some anticipated questions it’s still short on some details. Some of the items that it does deliver on include; AMT (Alternative Minimum Tax) Repeal, fewer tax Brackets, increased standard deductions, and the “death tax” repeal. Initial findings by the Tax Policy Center states that this package would add a $2.4 trillion hole in the federal budget but other estimates anticipate it to be closer to $1.5 trillion. Much of the proposed tax plan has yet to be finalized including income tax brackets, any changes to capital gains as well as the healthcare tax. It’s still too early to know what the final reform will look like if or when it actually passes. As always, you’re best served to focus on what you can do for 2017 taxes as what is what we can control. Here are a few items to think about as we kick off the 4th quarter:</p>
                <ol>
                <li>Are you on track to max out your 401k or employer sponsored plan?</li>
                <li>Any IRA contributions that can be taken advantage of?</li>
                <li>Tax-deductible HSA accounts?</li>
                <li>529 plans with state specific tax deductions? </li>
                <li>Tax loss harvesting opportunities?</li>
                </ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p><strong>Generation</strong>, <strong>geography</strong>, and <strong>gender</strong> can influence not only what parents are doing for their children, but also what they think their children want to be done for them. And how much money families have impacts not only what they do with their finances, but also how they talk about them.</p>
                <p>We commissioned a survey of 1,001 &#8220;affluent&#8221; (those with investable assets of $500,000 or more) to see how affluent Americans approach their families’ financial futures. <strong>Take our quiz </strong>to see how you compare to affluent families.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re excited to share with you the results from our most recent survey breaking down how affluent American families handle their finances. We commissioned the <a onclick="ga('send', 'event', 'CTA', 'Download', 'Personal-Capital-Affluent-Family-Finances-Survey-Q3-2017.pdf');" href="https://www.personalcapital.com/assets/email/Personal-Capital-Affluent-Family-Finances-Survey-Q3-2017.pdf" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Affluent Family Finances Survey</a> through <a href="https://orcinternational.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">ORC International</a>, which surveyed 1,001 parents in the United States with investable assets of $500,000 or more, to discover how affluent parents across generations – millennial, Gen X and baby boomer – view finances and their families.</p>
                <p>The survey uncovered new and interesting findings within four areas critical to the finances of affluent families: education, weddings, home buying and ongoing financial support. What we learned is that with more money, comes many more demands.</p>
                <h2>Gen Z Expectations of Their Millennial Parents</h2>
                <p>When millennial parents were asked what they believed their Gen Z children will expect of them financially, their answers alluded to setting up their future generations in ways that haven’t been done before.  </p>
                <p>Compared to 69% of all parents, a whopping nine in 10 millennial parents say that their kids will expect them to pay for milestone purchases, such as college, weddings, and their first home.</p>
                <p>With the rising costs of these big-ticket items, millennial parents are anticipating to foot some hefty bills, in a way not seen by prior generations. For example, 56% of millennial parents expect to pay $100,000 or more for their child’s college education. For the wedding, 45% plan to pay $50,000-plus, and 19% plan to pay $100,000-plus for their child’s big day. </p>
                <p>It’s truly remarkable that millennial parents plan to take on so much of this financial responsibility, especially since <a href="http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/personal-capital-study-reveals-millennials-saving-up-more-hope-than-money-for-retirement-300254316.html" rel="noopener" target="_blank">according to a study we did just last year</a>, approximately 40% of millennials overall don’t even have a retirement account. Not to mention, this most recent survey found that 70% of millennial parents say they would prioritize their child’s college education over their own retirement. </p>
                <p>While it’s great to see the ambition being shouldered by this new generations of parents, it also means there’s more responsibility than ever for today’s parents to plan their financial futures carefully.</p>
                <h2>To Children of Affluent Parents, Money <em>Does </em>Grow on Trees</h2>
                <p>Of course, every parent wants to help their kid succeed.  So, it comes as no surprise that across all generations, affluent parents have supported or plan to continuously support their children financially. However, what is surprising is that nearly two in 10 affluent parents plan to support their children into their 30s or beyond, with 13% of parents planning to continue supporting their children into their 40s and beyond. </p>
                <p>More than half of parents said they have helped or plan to help their child financially when they buy a home, and of that half, and  nearly half (45%) of parents overall have paid or expect to pay some or all of their child’s rent. In cities like San Francisco or a New York, where real estate comes at a premium whether you’re buying or renting, this can add up to quite an expense for those parents footing the bill. </p>
                <h2>We Need to Talk &#8211; About Our Finances</h2>
                <p>Affluent parents, across generations, are feeling increasing pressure from their children to provide longer term support; however, many are still uncomfortable talking about their finances. Ninety-seven percent of parents plan to leave behind a legacy, but only about half of the parents have disclosed their net worth to their children &#8211; and 22% never plan to tell their children their net worth. Yet of those planning to leave an inheritance, six in 10 think their children will be very responsible with the money.</p>
                <p>So how can parents start the conversation when preparing to leave behind a legacy? Well, show them the money! Today, more than ever, kids are using devices and apps for almost everything. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Personal Capital’s free dashboard</a> is the perfect place to initiate a dialogue about net worth &#8211; what it is, what goes into it, and how it’s crucial to reaching your long-term goals. Our free financial tools allow you &#8211; and your family &#8211; to plan for future purchases &#8211; such as that expected wedding, college education, or retirement &#8211; and serve as a great kick-off for important financial conversations.  </p>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>As a father myself, I believe families must begin engaging in these conversations in order to build more confidence that their children will be responsible with family finances. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Personal Capital’s tools</a> provide a comprehensive view of all the family accounts in one place, help  families get on the same page about finances, literally and digitally.

                <p><em><strong>Methodology</strong><br />
                This report presents the findings of an online study conducted among a sample of 1,001 respondents ages 18 or older, are parents, and have total household investable assets of $500,000 or more. The sample for the study came from an online panel. Invitations to participate in the study were sent beginning on September 7, 2017 and data collection continued through September 13, 2017. </p>
                <p>Respondents with multiple children were asked to focus on one child in the beginning of the survey, and were chosen through a random birthday selection.</p>
                <p>Respondents for this survey were selected from among those who have volunteered to participate in online surveys and polls. Because the sample is based on those who initially self-selected for participation, no estimates of sampling error can be calculated. All sample surveys and polls may be subject to multiple sources of error, including, but not limited to sampling error, coverage error, error associated with nonresponse, error associated with question wording and response options, and post-survey weighting and adjustments.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Paying for your child’s education is one of the largest financial mountains your family will have to climb, but opening a college savings account is a great starting point. One of the most common and popular savings vehicles is the 529 plan. In fact, of families who have not opened a 529 college savings plan in 2016, 62% intend to open one – a huge jump from the 52% in 2015.</p>
                <p>For most, one of the biggest challenges of saving for college is determining exactly how much that will be. There are so many unknown factors when it comes to calculating this number. The cost of college is rising each year. Your child may start at community college and then transfer to a university. They may be awarded a scholarship. Or they may just forego college altogether! There really is no telling what the magic number is when it comes to contributions to your 529 account. In some rare cases, a few meticulous savers find themselves in the extraordinary position of having more money saved than they actually need.</p>
                <p>The question remains: What do I do with the excess funds?</p>
                <p>Luckily, you have a few options for the unused money in your 529 accounts:</p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Get creative and use it</strong>One of the great things about 529 plans is that they’re not just for tuition. You can use the funds in this plan for ANY education-related expenses. That includes books, housing, computers, and even Wi-Fi!
                <p>Your student can also use the funds to cover classes at any eligible institution &#8212; any college, university, vocational school, or other postsecondary educational institution &#8212; that is qualified to participate in a student aid program administered by the U.S. Department of Education. With that said, you might want to also consider saving those excess funds to pay for their graduate school or continuing their education through personal interest classes in the future.</li>
                <li><strong>Keep it in the family</strong>If you’ve overfunded your student’s 529 plan, one option is to simply change the beneficiary. There are no tax consequences for changing to another family member. This can be nearly anyone else related to the child, such as siblings, parents, grandparents, first cousins, aunts, and uncles.
                <p>The only caveat is you can only transfer within the same generation or one generation up. This means that if you’ve overfunded your son’s college, you can transfer the excess by changing the beneficiary to your daughter’s name, OR you or another family member in your generation can become the beneficiary of the plan and use the funds toward continuing your education – a great idea for empty-nesters!</li>
                <li><strong>Bite the bullet and close the account</strong><br />
                While this isn’t the most tax-optimal choice, the beauty of a 529 account is there is no “use-it-or-lose-it” rule. The money you contribute is always yours to withdraw; however, you will owe ordinary income tax on the earnings (never on the deposits) if the money is used for non-education related expenses and you will be subject to a 10% penalty on the amount included in income.You can avoid the 10% penalty if your child earns either tax-free scholarships and grants, veteran’s educational assistance, employer-paid educational assistance, or attends a U.S. military academy. In those cases, you can withdraw the funds and only pay tax on the earnings while avoiding the penalty.</p>
                <p>Before you choose to withdraw your funds, double-check what kind of plan you have. Some prepaid tuition plans &#8212; which allow parents to purchase college credits at current rates – may only allow you to withdraw the principal invested in the plan. This means that you would lose out on any earnings.</p>
                <p>Additionally, there is a small possibility that your 529 plan decreased in worth due to poor investment management or <a href="http://www.reuters.com/article/us-column-college-bonds/college-savings-in-529-plans-may-be-worth-less-than-hoped-idUSKCN1BV1E0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a downturn in the market</a>. In this situation, you won’t owe tax or the 10% penalty and may be able to claim the loss on your tax return. However, you can only claim a loss after all amounts from the account have been distributed and the total distributions are less than your total contributions to the 529 plan.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>When you’re planning to save for college, it is important to know much you plan to save. If you are planning on funding your children’s entire college costs, we generally recommended to use 529 accounts for most of the funding (about 75% of the total estimated cost) and fund the remainder (about 25%) with another account type such as a UTMA, a joint account in the parent’s name, or taking out loans. You may lose out on some tax benefits of the 529, but you forego the consequences of closing out an overfunded 529. In the end, if you overfund the plan, the options are pretty straightforward: squeeze as much out of the plan as possible, update your beneficiary, or simply close it out. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schedule time with your financial advisor</a> to discuss your specific college savings strategy and account balances.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Global equities were calm despite hawkish comments from the Fed and more saber-rattling with North Korea. The US central bank indicated it still expects to raise rates by another 0.25% this year and revealed plans about the pace at which it will deflate its bloated balance sheet. The dollar initially rose on the news but finished about flat for the week. </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,502 (+0.1%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (-0.2%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.25% (+0.05%)<br />
                Gold: $1,297 (-1.8%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.195 (-0.0%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:</strong>    </p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> – Northrup Grumman offered to buy rocket maker Orbital ATK for $7.8 billion as competition for space-related military products heats up.</li>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> – Google proposed auctioning space to display items for sale on its shopping site.</li>
                <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> – Toys R Us filed for bankruptcy.</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – The Fed indicated it remains on track to raise rates this year and will begin shrinking its balance sheet next month. The dollar rose.</li>
                <li>
                <strong>Thursday</strong> – China lowered its rating on Chinese debt from AA- to A+. </li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – London said Uber was unfit to retain its license but will be able to operate while it appeals.</li>
                <li>
                <strong>Friday</strong> &#8211; Senator John McCain said he would vote against the latest effort to repeal the Affordable Care Act, lowering its chances for success.</li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – Facebook abandoned plans to change its share structure to allow Mark Zuckerberg to retain control even while selling shares to fund charitable issues</li>
                <p>.</ul>
                <h2>Our take:</h2>
                <p>Tensions between the US and North Korea have turned toward becoming a more personal feud between the leaders of the two countries. Both hurled insults at each other this week and a North Korean representative said the country may detonate a hydrogen bomb over the Pacific. This comes not long after the country threatened to sink Japan, and shot a missile over it in the same week. Sanctions announced Thursday are much more serious than have been in place in the past and will be felt in North Korea. </p>
                <p>Markets seem to have grown accustomed to these provocations. Just a few weeks ago any news of escalated tension resulted in an immediate dip in stock prices and a rush to safe havens. But as these mini-corrections proved short-lived investors have learned to ignore the new news. The problem is the tensions are getting worse, not better. </p>
                <p>It is concerning. We don’t believe individual investors should try to time markets based around impossible to predict and low probability geopolitical nightmare scenarios. They come up frequently. But it is starting to feel like North Korea will remain a source of volatility for some time to come and the market’s cavalier attitude may be forced to change.    </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>You went to Northwestern. Your partner went to Northwestern. Now, baby number one is here and they’re already geared up in a purple-and-white onesie. It’s a safe bet that baby number one will probably apply to Northwestern. As stated <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/education-wp/how-pay-kids-college/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously</a>, there are myriad options when it comes to choosing how you save for your child’s education. However, the 529 plan is typically the most common choice.</p>
                <h2>What is a 529 Plan?</h2>
                <p>A 529 plan is a state-sponsored, tax-advantaged savings plan designed to encourage saving for future college costs. 529 plans, legally known as “qualified tuition plans,” can also be sponsored by state agencies or educational institutions and are authorized by Section 529 of the Internal Revenue Code. There are numerous investment options in a 529 plan account and if your child receives a scholarship, you can withdraw the scholarship amount penalty-fee and transfer the funds to another beneficiary. Adversely, if you take out money from your 529 plan account to use for non-education expenses, you’ll incur a heavy penalty, and will also pay ordinary federal income tax and applicable state taxes if you received a deduction for your contributions.</p>
                <p>Think you know everything there is to know about 529s? Test your knowledge <a href="http://go.personalcapital.com/529-plans-infographic" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here!</a></p>
                <h2>Who Should Use a 529 Plan?</h2>
                <p>529 plans are primarily geared toward families who are fairly certain the beneficiary will attend college. Most plans offer valuable tax benefits and can be an attractive option for more “hands-off” investors (assuming an aged-based option is available). But there are tradeoffs. Here are some items to look out for and be aware of:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>High fees</strong><br />
                College savings plans sold through a broker may be loaded with commissions and fees, just like any other investment product. If fees are high, the tax benefits could fade relative to purchasing low-cost ETFs elsewhere.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimal control over the investment strategy</strong><br />
                According to the IRS rules, you can only adjust your 529 plan investments twice a calendar year (<a href="https://www.wsj.com/articles/rule-change-allows-529-investors-to-adjust-holdings-more-often-1420516879">rather than the once-yearly change permitted under previous Internal Revenue Service restrictions</a>). That’s a pretty significant downside in a volatile market. Investors looking for greater flexibility over investment choices might opt for a different plan.</li>
                <li><strong>Minimizes your child’s financial aid eligibility</strong><br />
                529 plans count as an available asset when the federal government and colleges calculate financial aid.</li>
                <li><strong>Living in a no-income tax state</strong><br />
                If you live in a state that provides a 529 deduction, choosing a plan in your state likely makes sense. If not, costs matter.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Frontloading Your 529 Plan</h2>
                <p>High-income earners (or people with a large enough estate) can put up to five years of the annual gift exemption into their children’s 529 accounts without gift tax issues.</p>
                <p><strong>Pros:</strong><br />
                When you front-load your 529 plan, your earnings will be compounded on more money over a longer time period. This means the more you put in initially, the longer that money has to grow and the greater the balance when it&#8217;s time to pay tuition. For example, you can contribute $70,000 (or $140,000 if you gift-split) into the 529 while your child is young to enjoy more years of investment growth and compounding. There is a true benefit in the ability to open a 529 plan, front load it and, at the same time, eliminate that amount from potential estate taxes. It&#8217;s also a very good use for a big bonus or inheritance.</p>
                <p><strong>Cons:</strong><br />
                With rising costs of college, it seems impossible to overfund a 529 plan but it does happen. As a reminder, for your funds to be withdrawn tax-free, the money must only be used toward qualified educational expenses.</p>
                <p>So, in the event you did overfund the account, the best choice is to use the surplus funds for another family member or even yourself if you decide to go back to school. If there is no alternative recipient and the excess funds are withdrawn, a 10% penalty and taxes will be due only on the earnings (not the original principal).</p>
                <p>For example, if your 529 account balance after all educational bills are paid is $6,000, and $2,000 of that amount makes up the earnings, the penalty would be 10% of $2,000 or $200. Income tax at your current tax bracket would also be owed on the $2,000.</p>
                <img class="alignnone  wp-image-46796" src="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed-300x54.png" alt="" width="651" height="117" srcset="https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed-300x54.png 300w, https://2vev8k188oi41n4g8wnqs79z-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/unnamed.png 704w" sizes="(max-width: 651px) 100vw, 651px" />
                <p>* Any amount over the amounts in the above chart can be placed in the UTMA/Minor accounts.</p>
                <h2>What to Do if You Overfund Your 529?</h2>
                <p>Remember: many children will get scholarships, decide to go to community college for at least one year or decide not to go to college altogether. Roughly 70% of graduating high school students will attend some type of college, meaning 30% will not. The more children you have the greater chance at least one will not require a full four-year university. If your child gets a scholarship, you can pull the equal amount out without penalty. If one of your children does not attend college, money can be transferred to another qualified beneficiary to be used for<br />
                education. Qualified beneficiaries include immediate family members, relatives of your<br />
                immediate family (e.g. nieces, uncles, etc.), in-laws, and first cousins.</p>
                <p>Keep in mind, a 10% penalty and ordinary income tax are charged on investment gains for non-qualified distributions. There is no penalty or taxes on principal – you would only pay a penalty on gains that you have deferred for a long period of time.</p>
                <p>If you are concerned about overfunding or not using a 529 plan, we generally recommend targeting a 529 plan for about 70% of the total expected college costs. Then you can transition to a taxable savings account until you reach the target savings amount. Still concerned about overfunding? You may want to try funding only your child’s first two years of college. Then, you can use a Roth IRA or taxable account – or your child can take out a loan – to fund the final years.</p>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>529 plans are helpful and appropriate in most situations. But in some cases, there can be other ways to invest that don’t have as much of a reduction to financial aid, limit investment flexibility. Consider your situation and goals to best determine which approach makes sense for you. Overall if you choose the right 529 it can bring significant tax benefits and allows for a lot of flexibility if you need to adjust beneficiaries.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>U.S. equities started the week strong as tensions surrounding Hurricane Irma and North Korea subsided, at least temporarily. The S&#038;P 500 hit multiple record highs as the week progressed. And despite a bit of volatility, international stocks were able to hold onto gains and end the week higher. Bond yields crept up, while oil prices rebounded on stronger demand forecasts from OPEC and the IEA. </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,500 (+1.5%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.9%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.20% (+0.15%)<br />
                Gold: $1,321 (-1.8%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.195 (-0.7%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:</strong>    </p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> – News surfaced that Chinese authorities planned to shut down the country’s bitcoin exchanges in an effort to prevent capital from fleeing to digital currencies. </li>
                <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> – Apple unveiled its new iPhone X, as well the iPhone 8 and other product updates at its annual September event.</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – It was reported that China is preparing to sell $2 billion of US-dollar denominated bonds, in its first such offering since 2004. </li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – U.S. weekly jobless claims fell to 284K, coming in better than expected. </li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – After weak figures for most of the year, the U.S. consumer-price index increased 0.4% in August from a month earlier. </li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – A bomb was detonated on a London subway train, injuring dozens of passengers. </li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – In defiance over recent sanctions, North Korea fired another missile that crossed over Japan’s northern island Hokkaido.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Takeaway:</h2>
                <p>Apple hosted its annual “special event” on Tuesday where, true to form, it announced a number of new products and updates. But this year was different. It marked the 10th anniversary of the iPhone’s inaugural launch, which produced an unusually large level of excitement leading up to the event. The media couldn’t help but speculate about the potential “iPhone X” announcement. After all, Apple has a history of groundbreaking innovation, and given this was the iPhone’s 10th anniversary, the newest release had to be big, right? Those not in attendance followed live updates online, eagerly awaiting Tim Cook’s earth-shattering announcement. And finally, after more than an hour of waiting, the moment came. . . </p>
                <p>The verdict? The iPhone X was more or less in line with expectations. It has some cool new features like a larger edge to edge OLED display, but then again Samsung already had that with their Galaxy S8. It boasts a 12-megapixel camera on both the front and back—again, something that’s been done before. Perhaps the most talked about feature was the new facial recognition technology to better secure and unlock the phone. On the surface, this certainly doesn’t seem as groundbreaking as the original iPhone was 10 years ago. But, does this mean Apple’s history of innovation is coming to an end? I’m sure there are some that would argue yes, but the jury is still out. Perhaps there’s another question to ask: does the company actually need to innovate at that level?</p>
                <p>Apple may not be the first mover into the edge-to-edge displays or higher megapixel cameras, but there is one trend many would agree with: they often produce the best, most polished version of whatever feature they’re offering (with certain exceptions of course). And that’s earned them a very loyal fan base. So loyal, in fact, that the company is betting it can jack up prices for the new phone to over $1,000. My personal opinion? People will buy it, probably including myself. </p>
                <p>But is this annualized upgrade/release cycle enough, or will the company need more groundbreaking releases to justify the world’s largest market valuation? That’s the trillion dollar question.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>College is expensive and today’s parents are learning they need to save early and often to cover the costs. As a result, many of them are faced with the challenge of saving for a comfortable retirement while also helping their child go to college.  </p>
                <p>The good news is, these long-term financial goals are not mutually exclusive. With a little bit of planning and strategic choice-making, you can contribute to your kids’ future without sacrificing your own long-term plans.</p>
                <h2>Determine Your Financial Needs</h2>
                <p>To put a plan in place, you must first decide what your financial needs are for each goal. Much of this is predicated on how you envision your retirement lifestyle. After all, how do you know how much you can put toward your child’s future if you don’t know how much you need for your own? Here are some important steps to understand what kind of retirement you want:</p>
                <h3>Five tips when planning for college and retirement:</h3>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Pick your dates</strong> – This goes for both retirement and when you think your child will start college. Regarding retirement, do you love your work? You might consider working longer. Is stress getting in the way of enjoying life? You might push this date earlier. Consider whether paying for your child’s education will affect that timing. If you contribute more toward their education, does that impact when you can afford to retire?</li>
                <li><strong>Track your budget</strong> &#8211; If you don’t track your expenses, now’s the time to start. Get a realistic understanding of what you spend every month, which will help you understand what you’ll need in retirement. A general rule of thumb: in retirement, you will need approximately 80% of your current income to cover your usual living expenses. As you think about what you need in retirement, you will want to factor in the cost of sending your child to college. Some good questions to ask yourself include:</li>
                <ul>
                <li>How many children do you have?</li>
                <li>How do you want to pay for their education? Will you cover all of it, or will they take out loans to cover some of it?</li>
                <li>Will they attend public or private school? If it’s the former, is it in-state or out-of-state?</li>
                <li>Does your child have any special academic, athletic, or artistic skills that could lead to a scholarship? </li>
                <li>Is your family eligible for financial aid?<br />
                These are all questions you should be considering, but if you don’t know what you’re currently spending, how do you know what you can spend in the future? </li>
                </ul>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">Know your cash flow</a></strong> &#8211; Calculate what will come in and what will go out each month. Find out about Social Security and pensions – when and how much they will pay. When looking at different ways to pay for your child’s education, keep in mind that you will most likely earn more later in life, which may impact when and how you want to start saving for their education.  As your child grows, so should your salary as well as your saving capabilities. This may be important when thinking about planning for the entire family.</li>
                <li><strong><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">See the big picture</a></strong> &#8211; Look at all your investment accounts together. Understand exactly how much you have, both in tax-advantaged and taxable investment accounts. This will help you develop financial goals, measure progress over time, and stay disciplined. Don’t forget, you should also track any college savings plans in your overall financial picture. You should be aware of the tax impacts these accounts have when looking at your whole financial picture. Savings plans such as traditional IRAs Coverdell ESAs are tax-deferred, while plans such as the Roth IRA are tax-exempt. If you decide to go with a 529, you can withdraw tax-free, as long as the funds are used for education-related expenses. For more information, read ‘<a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/financial-planning-2/how-pay-kids-college/" target="_blank">How to Pay for Your Kids’ College</a>’ on the tax drawbacks and benefits of each savings account.</li>
                <li><strong>Don’t be overwhelmed</strong> – There is a huge amount of information on college, finance, and retirement out there. Avail yourself of what interests you, but don’t let it overwhelm you to the point that you act rashly – or don’t act at all. If you’re unsure of where you can start, <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">speak with a financial advisor</a> who can help you sift through the information, as well as review and analyze your finances and formulate a plan to help you achieve your long-term financial goals.</li>
                </ol>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>So, what is more important—your child’s education and future or your own security at retirement? There’s no doubt that a lot of emotion gets wrapped up in that question, which often leads people to come to the wrong conclusion. Recently, many parents are deciding that college savings should come first. As a result, they’re dipping into their retirement savings to cover the costs.</p>
                <p>We highly recommend against this. Retirement is a necessity. If you do not adequately prepare for this stage in your life, you might become a financial burden to your child. In this situation, all of your hard work to financially support your children through college will be counteracted by the fact they now might need to financially support you.</p>
                <p>Saving for both your child’s education and your retirement are equally important. What is feasible for your retirement should help drive how much you can help your children for college. If you prioritize helping your children, then you should understand what you’re giving up to do so. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Saving for your children’s education is a high priority for many people.  With college costs continuing to rise faster than inflation, creating an education savings plan can be complex and challenging.  After determining which <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/financial-planning-2/how-pay-kids-college/" target="_blank">college savings strategy</a> fits best with your long-term financial goals, the next step is determining when to start saving.</p>
                <h2>The Early Bird Catches the Worm</h2>
                <p>As with anything related to investing, starting early is always better because it gives funds more time to grow. Starting right away, however, may not be possible for some parents. As strong as your desire to provide for your child’s future might be, there are some basic things to have in place before you begin saving for college:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Wait to start saving for college until you have other priorities, such as an emergency fund insurance and your own retirement savings on track.</li>
                <li>Ensure your personal needs are met first – providing for a child’s college education at the expense of your own financial well-being could mean you end up being a financial burden to your child in your retirement years.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>After covering these needs, start thinking about saving for college. This can be as little or as much as you want – don’t let the amount hold you back. It might not be easy to start putting money away initially because you may be balancing higher up-front costs, such as new medical needs, financing a family-friendly vehicle, and paying for daycare costs. However, the earlier you start, the more time your contributions have to vest and grow before paying that first tuition bill.  </p>
                <p>Once your child is 3, the upfront expenses you had will likely be paid off, and you can shift the amounts you were paying toward education savings.  When your child hits the age of 5, daycare costs often decline since he or she will be entering kindergarten. Continue the same thinking and reallocate those dollars to the college savings plan. This way, you increase your savings along the way and you can help your child fund some &#8211; or all &#8211; of their college expenses. </p>
                <h2>Saving and Income Projection</h2>
                <p>Income varies over a career, and understanding your projected career and salary trajectory helps in knowing when and how to save. After all, the salary you earned at 24 is likely not the same two decades later.  </p>
                <p><a href="https://www.bls.gov/news.release/pdf/wkyeng.pdf" target="_blank">The Bureau of Labor Statistics</a> reported that median weekly earnings were highest for men age 35 to 64, peaking between ages 45 to 54. For women, usual weekly earnings were also highest for those aged 35 to 64, peaking between ages 35 and 44. Men also tend to earn more than women at every single age group. When looking at different ways to pay for your child’s education, remember that you will most likely earn more later in life. As your child grows, so should your salary. This may be important when thinking about planning for the entire family. </p>
                <h2>How Much Should You Contribute?</h2>
                <p>A useful “average” cost for college is $25,000 per year for public schools and $40,000 for private schools. For babies or toddlers, funding about 30% of the expected total cost upfront makes sense if the money is available. $28,000 is a good starting amount because it is under the annual gifting limit. If a monthly program is preferred, contributing $250 a month is a good amount for young children targeting public university.</p>
                <p>One of the most common college savings vehicle is a 529 plan. This plan is a state-sponsored, tax-advantaged savings plan – also known as a “qualified tuition plan”- that is designed to encourage saving for future college costs. Because of overfunding penalties and unknown returns, for younger children we recommend targeting 50% to 70% of total college costs be funded by 529s. As children age, a higher percentage can be targeted. You can add more to a 529 without penalty, but it makes taxes more complicated. </p>
                <p>Keep in mind though, you should not sacrifice your retirement for your children’s education. You can always borrow for college; you can’t borrow for your retirement. The interest rates for federal student loans – the types of loans your children might take out if they need to – are usually less than what you can make by putting your money in retirement investments.</p>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>As with most financial goals, the sooner you take action, the better. Even if you can only afford to add a small amount, like $250 each month, those small amounts eventually add up over time. </p>
                <p>If you’re unsure of where you can start saving, <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">speak with a financial advisor</a> who can help you review and analyze your finances and formulate a plan to help you achieve your long-term financial goals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Earlier this week, <a href="http://money.cnn.com/2017/09/08/technology/equifax-hack-qa/index.html" target="_blank">news of a significant data breach at Equifax, Inc. broke</a>, affecting an estimated 143 million U.S. consumers. While this is not the largest breach of recent times, it may very well be the most damaging to American families due to the nature of the data that is now in the hands of cybercriminals. Only time will tell us what the true impact will be. Criminals usually need some time to parse through the information and organize their fraud strategies, so you may not see the effects until many months down the line.</p>
                <p>When companies leak your credit card information, it is unfortunate &#8211; but then the big card brands re-issue you new numbers and largely absorb the fraudulent transactions costs. In other words, you are largely protected from the repercussions, provided you notify the card issuer when you see fraudulent activity.  On the other hand, cybercriminals having such a rich data profile of your identity, such as what was made available by the Equifax breach, is a much greater risk to your digital safety. This information, (e.g. Social Security number, birth date, address, driver’s license, and other personal information) can empower full-fledged identity theft, as well as a takeover of your existing digital accounts, such as your bank, brokerage or email. </p>
                <p>Think about the last time you forgot your password to your bank’s website. When you reset your password, your bank usually asks you for information like your date of birth, your address, and the last four digits of your Social Security numbers &#8211; all private information that may now be in the hands of criminals. </p>
                <p>As your information trickles through the black markets with initial thieves selling it to fraudsters, we will see what is the full extent of the damage that comes.</p>
                <h2>Are my Personal Capital Accounts at Risk?</h2>
                <p>This breach does not affect Personal Capital in any direct way. Whether you are a user of our <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">free financial tools</a> or a <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">client of our wealth management services</a>, we make every effort to prevent your information being stolen, as security is a key priority for us. You can review key security measures we have in place on our <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software/security" target="_blank">Security Page</a> and our security team can always engage directly with clients who have specific concerns.   </p>
                <h2>What Should I Do?</h2>
                <p>In this day and age, the sad reality is that you need to expect assaults on your identity and cybersecurity. Identity theft can have lasting consequences on your financial health and here at Personal Capital, this is something that we care deeply about. Here are some of the things you can do right now to be in a strong defensive position to mitigate the risks associated with these types of events.</p>
                <p><strong>New credit account fraud</strong> &#8211; the risk that fraudsters will create new accounts in your name, damaging your credit and possibly leaving you accountable for debt.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><em>Sign up for the free monitoring services</em> &#8211; this should provide you with alerts when significant events happen. Monitor those closely. Equifax offers this for free now, but don’t forget that the free monitoring is for a limited time and if you do not want to pay for this, you will need to unsubscribe after a year. Do this before the next step as it may prevent you from subscribing to the monitoring if your file is frozen.</li>
                <li><em>Freeze your credit file</em> &#8211; Reach out to credit agencies (<a href="https://www.equifax.com/personal/?/" target="_blank">Equifax</a>, <a href="https://www.transunion.com/ppc-credit-report.page?&#038;channel=paid&#038;cid=ppc:GOOGLE:c:TU_B_MS_Core_Exact:transuinion:cid1&#038;kwid=43700005562521684&#038;opti_ca=166307821&#038;opti_ag=12095802781&#038;opti_ad=176432706601&#038;opti_key=kwd-90778192&#038;gclid=EAIaIQobChMI3eSGhcCW1gIVCyhpCh1xlw-iEAAYASAAEgJ7__D_BwE&#038;gclsrc=aw.ds&#038;dclid=CL7C5YbAltYCFRRnfgodL9gMHA" target="_blank">Transunion</a>, <a href="https://www.experian.com/lp/exp-cred-itp-2.html?bcd=ad_c_sem_427_205114532611&#038;k_id=bc3d0c3b-3cfb-4586-8e37-01007086d710&#038;k_kw=kwd-12618301&#038;k_mt=e&#038;pc=sem_exp_google&#038;cc=sem_exp_google_ad_27946959_915476739_205114532611_kwd-12618301_e_1t1_bc3d0c3b-3cfb-4586-8e37-01007086d710&#038;ref=headterm&#038;gclid=EAIaIQobChMIur65i8CW1gIVRJF-Ch16WwNIEAAYASAAEgJXAfD_BwE" target="_blank">Experian</a> and <a href="https://www.innovis.com/" target="_blank">Innovis</a>) and request your file be put on a “security freeze.” This is possibly the most effective option to prevent identity theft since it will prevent anyone from opening new accounts in your name (including yourself!). This is not usually widely publicized because the industry wants you to open more accounts. Should you need to open new credit accounts for your own benefit, you would need to unfreeze and refreeze your accounts. In some cases, unfreezing may take some time, so plan ahead if you need a new car, house or credit card. Some bureaus may ask you to pay a nominal fee for this; it is usually well worth it compared to the cost of recovering from identity theft and usually voided if you can demonstrate a legitimate risk of being subject to identity theft.</li>
                <li><em>Monitor your credit file</em>&#8211; You are entitled to at least one free credit report per year. Get this now and mark your calendar for next year. Dispute any anomalies. Use services or apps that will monitor this in real time &#8211;  some free and reputable options exist such as <a href="https://www.creditkarma.com/" target="_blank">Credit Karma</a> or <a href="https://www.creditsesame.com/893v1?gclid=EAIaIQobChMIo7X5ssCW1gIVx2B-Ch3zRgBOEAAYASAAEgJ8tfD_BwE" target="_blank">Credit Sesame</a>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Existing account fraud</strong> &#8211; the risk that your existing financial services account will be taken over, putting your current assets at risk.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><em>Actively monitor your financial accounts</em> &#8211; In many cases, if you spot fraudulent transactions quickly you may be able to stop or contest them. This is not convenient when you have to log into all your financial institutions accounts independently. This is an area where Personal Capital can help out. Using our dashboard, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&#038;v=jtc4lcDkNDg" target="_blank">link all your important accounts</a> and easily keep an eye on things. Review this every day or sign up for our daily review email. Respond quickly if you see suspicious activity by contacting the financial institution responsible for the account.</li>
                <li><em>Change the way you do passwords</em> &#8211; Most people will bore you with the usual “don’t reuse password” or “use super-complicated passwords” in the wake of such an event. While those are not bad advice, they are usually short on the how to make this practical. Here’s the how to effectively change how you do your passwords:</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Get a password manager tool; there are many out there (see <a href="http://lifehacker.com/5529133/five-best-password-managers" target="_blank">Lifehacker’s reviews</a> for insight). Getting one for your phone is usually simpler and more secure versus software on your desktop computer.</li>
                <li>Secure it with a very long passphrase that you will not forget. “Matt likes to dance in the rain” is better than “5ue@1s21%.”</li>
                <li>Once that is done, change all your passwords for important accounts to the long passwords that you will store in your password manager (and update your Personal Capital dashboard!).</li>
                </ul>
                </ul>
                <p>If you implement the action plan above, you should be able to reduce the potential impact to you and your family of this data breach. We hope this helps you and your loved ones and keeps everyone’s financial lives sound.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Devastating natural disasters and jitters over North Korea pushed the market down to start the week after the Labor Day holiday. Stocks tried, but were unable to recover fully over the remainder of the week. Stanley Fischer, the Fed’s number two official, stepped down – a move some investors interpreted as meaning the Fed will stay more accommodative longer. Bond yields and the dollar fell. In a surprise move, President Trump sided with Democrats in passing a bill to raise the debt ceiling, extend government funding for three months, and approve $15 billion in disaster relief for Hurricane Harvey. </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,461 (-0.4%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.6%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.05% (-0.09%)<br />
                Gold: $1,346 (+1.6%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.203 (+1.4%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> – US equity markets moved to a T+2 settlement cycle, reducing by one the number of days investors have to wait to access funds when selling stock.</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – Brazil’s central bank cut its benchmark lending rate by 1% to 8.25%.</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – Fat Brands, parent of Fatburger, filed to raise $24 million in an IPO.</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – Toys R Us retained legal counsel to help restructure $400 million of debt due next year.</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Amazon announced it will begin a search for a second US headquarters location, spending up to $5 billion to build and operate it. </li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Eli Lilly said it would cut up to 8% of its workforce and invest more in new drugs.</li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – Credit reporting company Equifax said hackers had compromised personal data on up to 143 million US consumers. </li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – Hundreds of thousands of people evacuated in Florida as the state braces for Hurricane Irma.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>The dollar passed above $1.20 to the euro for the first time since the very end of 2014. US currency is down 9.1% against a basket of 16 others so far in 2017. Declines have come as investors have lost confidence President Trump will be able to push through much of his pro-growth agenda and as the Fed has taken a more dovish tone in the face of low inflation.</p>
                <p>The resignation of Stanley Fischer means President Trump will have even greater control over the future of who runs the Fed. Most likely those appointed by him will be hesitant to raise rates aggressively and risk slowing the economy in the second half of his term. Hurricanes Harvey and Irma may also make it more difficult politically for the Fed to raise rates.</p>
                <p>All of this is a major reason why international stocks are significantly outpacing US stocks so far this year when measured in dollar terms. It could be that the pendulum has finally swung, but it is important to keep perspective. Just a few years ago the dollar was at $1.40 to the euro and the last 7 years have been absolutely dominated by US stocks in terms of asset class returns. </p>
                <p>We prefer to keep a strategic, long term mix between the US and international stocks and bonds and rebalance periodically rather than guess year by year. On the currency front, the current levels actually feel about right and are more balanced on a purchasing parity basis than we’ve generally seen in recent years. It could be that the dollar overshot a little on the way up and is now in a more stable place. </p>
                <p>Our thoughts are with all of those impacted by the storms in Texas and Florida.   </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>They’ve taken the SATs (three times). They’ve gone back and forth on what their major should be and what career path they want to take. They’ve dragged you along on campus visits. And now, they’re waving goodbye as they rush off to orientation.</p>
                <p>You’ve blinked your eyes and now your kids are becoming college students. You can’t put a price on their excitement, but you can on the tuition bill you might be left to foot.</p>
                <p>Saving for your child&#8217;s college education can seem like a daunting task. Unlike with retirement savings, few clear guidelines exist. College costs vary widely depending on where your child goes to school and whether they qualify for financial aid. So how can you afford your child’s dream school, without sacrificing your own retirement fund? The key is to start saving early and identify the savings vehicle(s) that aligns best with your long-term financial goals. </p>
                <h2>
                College Savings Plan Options</h2>
                <p><strong>529 Plan</strong><br />
                One of the most common savings vehicles is the state-sponsored college savings plan: the 529. 529 plans benefit over traditional taxable accounts because their investment gains grow and can be withdrawn tax free as long as they’re used for qualifying expenses. Many states also offer additional tax benefits to local residents who invest in their respective state’s plan. While there is no limit on annual contributions, there are lifetime limits that vary by state, which are typically $200,000 or more. </p>
                <p><strong>Student Loans &#038; Aid</strong><br />
                Student loans offer several long-term benefits and can fill big financial gaps. Yes, loans shift the burden of repayment to your child, but this method also helps them build credit as they pay it back. </p>
                <p>There are a few options if you decide student loans and aid are the right route for you:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Federal Aid</strong><br />
                Federal Student Aid (FSA) – part of the Department of Education – is the largest source of financial aid in the United States, offering loans, grants and work study funds. Federal loans have flexible repayment options and competitive rates. They also offer deferments and other features that most other loans don’t. Federal grants can be merit-based, need-based or student-based, and do not need to be repaid. Many factors determine your aid eligibility. While your income (and family income, if you’re a dependent) is one driving force, the cost of the school you’re attending, your year in school, your enrollment status and expected family contribution also matter. The financial aid office at your college will use all of these factors to determine how much financial aid you are eligible to receive.</li>
                <li><strong>Subsidized v Unsubsidized Loans</strong><br />
                The federal government pays the interest on a subsidized student loan while the student is in college or if the loan is deferred. Unsubsidized loans accrue interest when the loan begins. There are borrowing maximums, depending on the year in school, including for graduate students. Interest rates and fees vary.</li>
                <li><strong>State Aid</strong><br />
                State governments also offer grants, scholarships, work-study funds, state loans and tuition assistance.</li>
                <li><strong>Institutional Aid</strong><br />
                Some colleges and universities provide aid to their students through scholarships, grants and work-study programs via institutional aid programs that come from their own resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Private Loans</strong><br />
                An alternative to federal loans, especially if you need to borrow a higher amount. However, these loans are more expensive, averaging 9-12% annually.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>As always, you should not sacrifice your retirement for your children’s education. You can always borrow for college; you can’t borrow for your retirement. The interest rates for federal student loans – the types of loans your children might take out if they need to – are usually less than what you can make by putting your money in a good long-term investment strategy. </p>
                <p><strong>Coverdell Educational Savings </strong><br />
                A Coverdell Education Savings Account (ESA) is a trust or custodial account whose sole purpose is to pay for qualified education expenses for beneficiaries under the age of 18 (or special-needs beneficiaries). Formerly known as a low-contribution education IRA, a Coverdell ESA may be used for private K-12 education expenses or qualifying college expenses (tuition and fees, books, supplies, equipment, room and board). While there is no limit on the number of accounts your child may have, there are limits to total contributions. Most traditional mutual funds, exchange traded funds, stocks, bonds or CDs may be used inside of a Coverdell ESA. </p>
                <p>Coverdell ESAs enjoy tax benefits similar to a Roth IRA. Money grows tax deferred and may be removed tax free for qualifying expenses, although contributions themselves aren’t deductible. According to the IRS, if an account’s distributions aren’t more than your child’s qualified education expenses at an eligible educational institution (in one year), then your child won’t owe tax on the distributions. </p>
                <p><strong>Custodial Accounts</strong><br />
                Custodial accounts – aka Uniform Gift to Minors Act (UGMA) or Uniform Transfer to Minors Act (UTMA) accounts – are another way to save for college expenses. An adult, such as a parent or grandparent, is the custodian for this type of account until your child reaches the age of majority, usually 18. This means the custodian makes all investment decisions for the account. UGMA accounts can only hold money and securities while UTMA accounts can hold other types of property. As with many of these methods, custodial accounts have distinct benefits and drawbacks. For example, there are no contribution limits (gift and generation skipping taxes aside); however, there is also no tax-deferred growth or tax-free withdrawals. If you start saving while your child is young, this could add up to a large tax bill. Also, if there is a significant amount in these accounts, it could affect qualifications for financial aid. </p>
                <p><strong>IRAs</strong><br />
                IRAs offer greater flexibility when saving for college —you maintain full control over the underlying investments. But, this also means they require greater responsibility and may not be ideal for “hands off” investors. You would be responsible for monitoring and maintaining the portfolio allocation over time. This could complicate things because you would be saving for two different timelines, your retirement and college goals. </p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Traditional IRAs</strong><br />
                These accounts are tax deferred, so money is deposited pretax, and taxes are not due on principal or earnings until withdrawal. While distribution is taxed at your ordinary income rate, you can withdraw money penalty-free at any age for qualified educational expenses, such as tuition, books, fees and supplies. </li>
                <li><strong>Roth IRAs</strong><br />
                These accounts are tax exempt, which means money is contributed after tax, but earnings and dividends accrue tax free (though they are subject to early withdrawal restrictions). A Roth IRA may be beneficial if you’re unsure whether your child will attend college or if you want to maintain monetary flexibility. This makes a Roth IRA a great investment option if you’re willing and/or capable of sacrificing its use as a retirement vehicle. It is important to prioritize your own retirement over paying for college &#8211; you can get a student loan for college if needed, but there’s no loan for your retirement. Keep in mind, there are investment and income limits to a Roth IRA. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, contribute to that account before a 529 plan.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>Saving for your children’s education is obviously important, but making sure you are saving for your retirement is equally as important.  If you’re confident your child will attend college, max out any retirement account options – such as a 401k (especially if your company matches) or IRA – before you fund a 529 or any other education-specific account. The tax deduction and long deferred growth of retirement accounts tends to outweigh the tax-free growth in your 529 for a shorter period of time. If you’re eligible for a Roth IRA, you should also contribute to that account before a 529. The principal can be pulled anytime, including for education expenses. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A strong week helped keep the S&#038;P 500’s monthly winning streak alive, although the red-hot NASDAQ had the first negative down month in recent memory. The devastation of Harvey and more provocations by North Korea were overlooked by investors in favor of strong GDP growth, potential tax reform, a friendly jobs report and views that central banks will remain accommodative.</p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,477 (+1.4%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.5%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.16% (-0.01%)<br />
                Gold: $1,325 (+2.6%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.186 (-0.4%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:</strong>    </p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Monday </strong>– Apple announced it will hold a product launch event on September 12th.</li>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> – Gilead Sciences bought Kite Pharma for $11 billion in a bet on a new kind of cancer therapy.</li>
                <li><strong>Monday</strong> – Amazon made waves by announcing price cuts on a broad range of items at recently acquired Whole Foods.</li>
                <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> – United Technologies was said to be near a deal to acquire Rockwell Collins for more than $20 billion.</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – Q2 GDP growth was revised up to 3.0%.</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Uber’s new CEO set a timeline for planned IPO at 18-36 months.</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Wells Fargo increased its estimates of potentially unauthorized accounts opened from 2.1 million to 3.5 million.</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Treasury Secretary Mnuchin said the White House will release tax reform plans in the coming weeks. </li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – The US economy added 156,000 jobs in August, a minor slowdown from the previous two months. Unemployment ticked up to 4.4%.</ul>
                </li>
                <h2>Our Takeaway:</h2>
                <p>The Trump administration promised more detail on planned tax reform in the coming weeks. So far it has been big on promises but light on details. Statements to the public have focused on potential tax reductions for the middle class, but the biggest impact could be on corporate rates, which Trump wants to lower. It is debatable if this is good for the country, but it probably would be good for owners of stocks. We think the likelihood of passage of some kind of tax bill is high but far from certain. Many on the GOP side are desperate to show some kind of success. </p>
                <p>Some potential benefits are likely already priced into stock prices so if nothing happens it would be a negative for the market, but it is hard to gauge the magnitude. Meanwhile, most people making market bets on politics or legislation over the last few years have been mostly wrong, so while we continue keep an eye on things like individual capital gains rates, for now we don’t think most investors should spend time worrying about tax legislation that may or may not ever happen.</p>
                <p>Separately, <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/personal-capital-news/5-billion-aum/" target="_blank">Personal Capital surpassed $5 billion in assets under management</a> this week. It is a nice milestone for us and helps validate that the combination of people and technology which we created, truly can create a better wealth management service in a scalable way. A big thank you to all of our clients and software users for making it possible. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Disability insurance covers your earned income in the event of a disability that prevents you from doing your job. If you are no longer able to earn an income, but still have spending needs, then you can end up being a burden on your loved ones. The loss of an income can be financially devastating if not properly planned for; having a safety net can make a lot of sense, particularly for families with a sole breadwinner.</p>
                <h2>Who Should Have Disability Insurance</h2>
                <p>Typically, all employed people should consider this type of insurance. Because its main purpose is to replace income lost due to a disability, it’s good for self-employed individuals, households with a nonworking spouse, and people without an employer sponsored policy. Disability insurance is usually structured to replace 60%-70% of monthly income. You can choose the length of your elimination period (the period between injury and receipt of benefit payments); although 90 days is the most common length, you should choose an elimination period that aligns with your emergency savings.</p>
                <h2>Disability Insurance &amp; Employment</h2>
                <p>Companies may also take policies out on “key” employees, which is called “Key-Person Disability” insurance. This type of disability insurance aims to financially protect a company in the case that a key employee becomes disabled. If you are self-employed, you can buy disability insurance for yourself and can write it off as a business expense. </p>
                <p>It’s especially important if you are self-employed to have this type of insurance, since your business likely would struggle to function in the event you are not able to work, and you need this as income replacement. It can also be very useful for one-income families or those with tight cash flows.</p>
                <h2>Short-Term Disability Insurance</h2>
                <p>Short-term disability coverage, which typically provides coverage for less than a year, is often packaged as an employee benefit, and offered through your workplace. If you have a company-paid plan, then the disability payments received will be taxable. Premiums are usually based on age, job title, health, elimination period desired, monthly benefit desired, and length of coverage.</p>
                <h2>Long-Term Care Insurance</h2>
                <p>Long-term disability insurance is usually purchased privately. The claim may last from one-to-three years, but when you purchase the policy, you have the option to choose multiple benefit durations. These can range from two years, all the way to the age of 70. This will affect the cost of your policy, but it’s something you can elect at the time you purchase it. Individual policies are a tax-free benefit if paid for by the insured.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Today we’re thrilled to announce that we now have $5 billion in assets under management (AUM) for our valued clients. We&#8217;ve never been in a better position to fulfill our mission to improve more financial lives through technology and people — whether it’s our great team, our growth capital or our clarity of vision. This $5 billion mark is a great symbol of our ongoing success.  </p>
                <p>Our unique combination of technology and people continues to be embraced at a breakneck pace. Investors are increasingly coming to us as they realize their financial life is too complex to manage on their own, or they are missing opportunities to improve their investment strategy because they lack a holistic approach when their finances are managed by someone else. Our tools offer consumers a view of their entire financial life, which helps them understand the importance of diversification and avoiding costly, often hidden, fees.</p>
                <h2>A Reflection on the Past Year</h2>
                <p>In the past year alone, we have gained $2 billion in AUM. Our growth in the last year only reaffirms that we are truly solving a major pain point for consumers by offering sustainable, objective financial advice and full financial transparency through our mobile app and online dashboard. Not only is our AUM on a rapid growth trajectory, but so is our average initial account size. The average initial investment amount for new clients has grown 37%, from $289,000 to $395,000. Our Private Client Service, which works with investors with $1 million or more in investable assets, now comprises about 39% percent of our AUM. </p>
                <h2>The Journey Ahead</h2>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Property and casualty insurance is an umbrella term that covers several different types of insurance. It refers to two different types of protection: property refers to protection of the things you own, and casualty refers to financial protection in the event you are sued.</p>
                <p>You may be asking yourself: do I need property insurance? There are numerous types of insurance policies that are grouped under the property and casualty insurance name and it’s important to know exactly what they cover.</p>
                <p>Some of the most common types of property and casualty insurance include:</p>
                <p><strong>Homeowners Insurance</strong><br />
                Homeowners insurance can cover numerous items associated with your home, from the property itself to what’s inside. You’ll want to make sure you are properly insured when it comes to your home, and that your policy is based on accurate and up-to-date replacement costs.</p>
                <p>Homeowners insurance covers a multitude of losses, or perils, as they’re commonly referred to in insurance policies. Coverage can be provided on an “all perils” basis, or a “named perils” basis. Be sure to carefully read what types of perils are and are not covered under your policy.</p>
                <p>Perils that typically are <em>not</em> covered include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Acts of war</li>
                <li>Flood damage</li>
                <li>Natural disasters where damage is caused by floods or earth movement (such as earthquakes, mudslides, sinkholes)</li>
                <li>Mold</li>
                <li>Parts of the property that cannot be repaired (roofing, old plumbing, heating units)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Perils that typically are covered include:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>Fire</li>
                <li>Wind (although technically a natural disaster, winds from a tornado or hurricane are typically included under covered perils)</li>
                <li>Hail</li>
                <li>Theft</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Another type of insurance, known as casualty insurance, will only cover a specifically named incident that happens in your home, such as injuries sustained on your property for which you are liable, or if your home is vandalized or damaged. There are also regionally specific policies that are offered by the government – these are usually a requirement by your lender.</p>
                <p><strong>Auto Insurance</strong><br />
                Typically, auto insurance is required in almost every state for all drivers. It is important to know your auto insurance is adequate in the event you are liable for damage. This is direct asset protection and the coverage can vary significantly. Lower premiums do not necessarily mean adequate insurance coverage, so it’s a good idea to take cheaper rates with a grain of salt. Your coverage should be closely aligned with cash on hand, as well as emergency savings and taxable investment accounts.</p>
                <p>Consult your insurance agent to review your auto insurance policy to ensure it’s appropriate given your assets subject to creditors.</p>
                <p><strong>Renter’s Insurance</strong><br />
                Like homeowners insurance, renter’s insurance can help protect your belongings if you rent your home. If you rent, it’s a good idea to have this – and monthly premiums can be as low as $14 per month. This will come in handy if your neighbor upstairs leaves their water running and your ceiling starts to drip on your electronics, or someone leaves the front door to your building open and unwanted guests get inside.</p>
                <p><strong>Landlord Insurance</strong><br />
                If you are a property owner renting out one or more residences (including single-family homes, condos, and apartments), then landlord insurance will protect your property from damages and lost income should damages make the properties unlivable.</p>
                <p><strong>Powersports Insurance</strong><br />
                Powersports insurance covers the types of vehicles outside of your car. If you’re the proud owner of RVs and/or motorcycles, most states require you to have insurance. If you own a vehicle such as a boat or snowmobile, while it’s not required in every state (check out the laws in your state), consider purchasing powersports insurance anyway, so you can enjoy them without worry.</p>
                <p>While the above are the most common types of property and casualty insurance, there are many other types of insurance for some of the more uncommon needs, such as insurance for drones or artwork. Many of these types of insurance can be grouped into other policies you already have – for instance, you may consider adding jewelry that is valued at over $2,500 on to your homeowner’s insurance. Just be careful to double-check the conditions under which those items are covered. And remember, bundling your insurances can often help lower costs.</p>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>Everyone’s needs are different, which is why it is important to figure out how much insurance coverage you need to protect yourself adequately without overpaying on unnecessary coverage. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management/advisors" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Schedule an appointment with a financial advisor</a> for advice on which policies match with your long-term goals.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most people spend August manning the grill or hitting the beach. However, August is also “National Make a Will” month. Although the month is now coming to a close, it’s not too late to start thinking about planning your will.</p>
                <p>People tend to think planning a will is morbid, but it’s actually about life and making sure that your assets provide support for the people you love. It isn’t about controlling from the grave, it’s about creating opportunities that continue to give benefit for years to come. </p>
                <p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/191651/majority-not.aspx">According to a recent Gallup poll</a>, only 44% of Americans have a will. Are you one of the majority who doesn’t have one? </p>
                <h2>The Components</h2>
                <p>Sometimes the vernacular regarding these types of conversations can become confusing. What’s the difference between a last will and testament versus a living will versus an estate plan vs a trust?</p>
                <p>Very simply put – and from a 35,000-foot level – here is how to distinguish them:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>An <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/estate-planning-isnt-just-about-taxes/" target="_blank">estate plan </a>is more comprehensive than your will – in fact, both a last will and testament and a living will are usually part of the estate plan. First, an estate plan identifies the people you want to benefit from your assets. Second, an estate plan identifies the people you trust to take care of yourself and your assets if you’re unable to do so. </li>
                <li>A last will and testament is a legally binding document that distributes your assets and assigns heirs and guardians after your death. </li>
                <li>A living will (aka an advanced directive) is a document that grants trusted advisors to navigate financial and health decisions should you become incapacitated.</li>
                <li>A <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/financial-planning-2/protecting-your-assets-with-a-trust/" target="_blank">trust</a> can also be part of an estate plan, and is a legal entity you set up to hold, safeguard, distribute and control all your assets.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Creating a Will</h2>
                <p>If you don’t have a will, now is the time to create one. There are ways you can DIY the task by purchasing forms online, especially if you don’t have too many complex factors to consider.<br />
                Digital wills are becoming more popular these days; however, if you don’t want to use an online service to store your documents and if you don’t have extensive assets, you can create a will online inexpensively and then print your documents and store them in a place where your family members could find them. You could also leave them with your attorney and make sure your family members know the name of your attorney. Be sure to list any important passwords or other information your family should know should something happen to you.</p>
                <p>If you have more complex finances, you will likely want to consult a financial advisor or estate attorney to draft one. Wills can get complicated and you want to ensure you’re intentions are honored the way you want them to be once you pass.</p>
                <h2>Components of a Will</h2>
                <p>You will want to designate a guardian for your children if something happens to you and your spouse. Even if you don’t have children, you should also compile a complete list of your assets, financial accounts, credit cards, investments and debt that will be easily accessible to the surviving spouse, family member, or trustee. This will make it easier to locate and distribute assets according to your wishes. You’ll also want to review beneficiaries on any retirement and life insurance accounts.    </p>
                <p>Most states require the following for your will to be valid:</p>
                <ul>
                <li>You should be at least 18 years old</li>
                <li>You should be of “sound mind” </li>
                <li>You will need to include what you want done with your assets and property, and if you have minor children, include who will become guardian</li>
                <li>Usually wills are typed or generated by a computer (handwritten wills have different provisions), and should include the statement that this document is your will</li>
                <li>You should appoint an executor who will ensure your estate is distributed correctly according to your will</li>
                <li>You should have at least two witnesses who will see you sign the will, are 18 years or older, are not beneficiaries of your will, and will also sign the will</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Updating Your Will</h2>
                <p>Most people draft their will around a major life event like getting married or having a child – but then they don’t update it as their life progresses. More children, grandchildren, deaths or divorce are just some of the life events that can change the will’s original intent.<br />
                <br />
                If you have a will, have you updated it lately and have you done it in a way that will avoid conflict for the rest of the family? Is there a plan to distribute assets in a way that won’t cause more grief after you are gone? You may want to consider the number of beneficiaries you have, or whether there are grandchildren to whom you wish to bequeath your property. Do you have a plan in the event that you and your spouse pass at the same time? An estate planning attorney and a financial advisor – even if there isn’t a trust involved – can be great resources.<br />
                <br />
                Not having an updated will relevant to your current situation can cause strife within an already grieving family. Double-check your will on a regular basis to make sure it’s written the way you want on your current circumstances.</p>
                <h2>If You Don’t Have a Will</h2>
                <p>If you die without a will, the intestacy laws of your state will determine what happens to your property and assets. Typically, your spouse (domestic partner in some states) or children will be the first to inherit your assets; if you are not married and don’t have children, then other relatives may be the recipient of your estate. No relatives? The state usually receives your assets and property in that case. If you are not married, but have a long-term partner, then not having a will that clearly states how you intend your assets to be distributed can mean your final wishes will be ignored. Since intestacy laws usually only recognizes relatives, you will want to clearly state your intentions in a will. The laws of succession vary based on what state you live in, so make sure you check to see what the laws are – or better yet, make sure you have a will.</p>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>Death and dying are never fun subjects, but not having a will can make them even more dismal. Creating a will allows your wishes to be clearly stated, and it helps your beneficiaries divide your assets and take care of any outstanding debts. As National Make a Will Month ends, use this time to understand the importance of having a will and take the steps to either create or update one.</p>

                <h2>Our Takeaway:</h2>
                <p>With all the unpredictability in the market and the environment, it’s important to focus on the things you can control. Make sure you are taking the right steps in organizing your financial life. One way to organize, is to ensure you have a will. And as luck would have it, it’s National Make a Will month. </p>
                <p>Although people tend to think planning a will is morbid, it’s actually about life and making sure that your assets provide support for the people you love. It isn’t about controlling from the grave, it’s about creating opportunities that continue to give benefit for years to come. </p>
                <p><a href="http://www.gallup.com/poll/191651/majority-not.aspx" target="_blank">According to a recent Gallup poll,</a> only 44% of Americans have a will. Are you one of the majority who doesn’t have one? </p>
                <p>Death and dying are never fun subjects, but not having a will can make them even more dismal. Creating a will allows your wishes to be clearly stated, and it helps your beneficiaries divide your assets and take care of any outstanding debts. As National Make a Will Month ends, use this time to understand the importance of having a will and take the steps to either create or update one.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>Most of us have seen some form of the disclosure, “Past performance is not necessarily indicative of future results.” Many investors, however, fail to take it to heart when making decisions about their investment strategy.</p>
                <p>This effect is common enough that is has its own name: Recency bias. Recency bias is the tendency to think that trends and patterns in the recent past will continue in the future, which then impacts certain conclusions, decisions or behaviors. From an investment perspective, this means you may be letting the euphoria of the long-running bull market influence your investment decisions too much. </p>
                <h2>How Can Recency Bias Impact Your Portfolio?</h2>
                <p>This bias can be particularly dangerous during periods of rising markets because it can grow stronger as the market reaches higher peaks. For example, today’s bull market celebrated its eighth birthday a few months ago, making it one of the longest running rising markets in history. This lengthy run helps lull us into a false sense of security, which can translate into trouble &#8211; how do you think asset bubbles are created? </p>
                <p>The dotcom bubble before the turn of the century saw the NASDAQ index increase from below 1,000 to more than 5,000 during a five-year period, as investors poured money into anything with a “.com” attached to its name. Recency bias works the opposite way, too, when you experience negative events. In 2008, the economy was teetering on the precipice and the stock market crashed. Many investors quickly determined that these negative events would continue and they liquidated their investment portfolios. When the financial markets rebounded, many of those same investors realized their error and jumped back into the markets. Unfortunately, they locked in their losses and bought back in after much of the recovery had already happened. Recency bias cost those investors a lot.</p>
                <h2>When is Recency Bias Most Dangerous?</h2>
                <p>If you are nearing retirement, wearing recency-bias-colored glasses can be especially dangerous. For example, if you’ve put together a substantial nest egg and you’re thinking of retiring in a couple of years, don’t let the returns of the past few years lead you to take on more risk. You may think boosting your savings could mean more luxurious choices when you finally leave the rat race, but it could actually lead to more damage than good. What happens to your investments immediately before and/or immediately after you retire have much more impact on your overall lifestyle than events that happen considerably before or after you retire. </p>
                <h2>Tips to Prevent Recency Bias from Harming Your portfolio</h2>
                <p>Since recency bias is a natural human tendency, how can you avoid being tricked by your own brain? Here are some tips to keep this bias in check, including:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">Seek an accurate picture of your financial assets and liabilities</a></li>
                <li>Establish achievable financial goals aimed at your long-term needs</li>
                <li>Identify and prioritize your risk tolerance levels and stick to your long-term plan vs. short-term trends</li>
                <li>Determine how much time you have to save to reach your goals</li>
                <li><a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">Find appropriate professional assistance to help keep you on track</a></li>
                </ul>
                <p>Keeping these tips in mind means you may minimize your impulse-based decisions, which is a good start. Then, in the words of Odysseus, &#8220;put wax in your ears &#8211; tie yourself to the mast if you must — and ignore the bull market’s Sirens song&#8221;. Don’t let recency bias guide you into the rocks when it comes to your investments and make sure to stay focused on your long-term goals. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The Background</h2>
                <p>Rodolfo was in his late 30s, engaged to be married and was on a quest to buy his first home in New England. He approached his financial advisor about how to finance a home, and in reviewing all his available assets to determine how much he could afford, they uncovered <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/whole-life-insurance-vs-universal-life-insurance/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">two life insurance policies</a> – both of which had a cash value.</p>
                <h2>The Challenge</h2>
                <p>A life insurance broker had sold Rodolfo two life insurance policies around a decade before. One was a universal life policy and the other was a whole life policy, two types of policies that accumulate cash, but are very expensive and not efficient from an investment standpoint.</p>
                <p>Rodolfo sat down with his financial advisor who walked him through a full insurance needs review, evaluating his income, his assets, what he would be protecting (the reason why he would purchase insurance), and his financial goals – in this case, buying a home. He didn’t have any children, his fiancée was in the workforce with a healthy salary, and there weren’t any other dependents he needed to be concerned about leaving assets to. In short, there wasn’t a great reason why he bought these policies. However, he needed cash for his purchase, and he was still paying into these expensive insurance policies.</p>
                <h2>The Solution</h2>
                <p>Rodolfo and his advisor discovered that the universal life policy had accumulated about $30,000 worth of cash value, which, unfortunately, was less than what he had paid into the policy at that point. This did mean, however, that there were no tax consequences for him to surrender the policy (i.e. withdraw the funds). Because he didn’t have insurance needs at the time, wanted cash for a home down payment, and any potential future insurance needs could be met through buying term insurance, Rodolfo surrendered his first policy and used that toward his down payment. His other policy was structured a bit differently and had a longer surrender schedule, which meant he could face penalties by the insurance company as well as small tax liabilities if he surrendered it. His advisor recommended he hold onto that policy through the surrender period, but if he needed the cash, he might be able to access it without too much of a financial hit.</p>
                <h2>The Results</h2>
                <p>Through the course of a full insurance needs analysis, Rodolfo determined his insurance needs could be met through a much simpler, less expensive policy, and could use the policies he had already purchased to fund some other investment – in this case a home purchase. Rodolfo ended up successfully purchasing his first home, and he and his now-wife are enjoying homeownership to the fullest. <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management/advisors" target="_blank">Schedule an appointment with a Personal Capital advisor</a> to help review your situation to ensure all your financial components – including annuities – are considered to maximize your total financial benefit.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>A quick check of the financial news reveals that the stock market has moved into its ninth straight year of rising values. So, what does this mean? It means that diversification is more important than ever.</p>
                <h2>The Cyclical Nature of Financial Markets</h2>
                <p>Some analysts and financial pundits issue dire predictions of pending doom, likening the current market to the days immediately before historic crashes, such as the Great Depression. Others say today’s low interest-rate environment, coupled with several other factors, means the market is valued fairly. Some honest types readily admit that they believe the stock market is overvalued, but they have also believed that for the past three years. </p>
                <p>The truth is, if market peaks could be accurately predicted, we would never be caught by bubbles, recessions, or plain old market crashes. All markets are cyclical and unpredictable; when one market cycle finishes, the next begins. </p>
                <p>Unfortunately, during prolonged bull markets, many investors tend to forget about the cyclical nature of the financial markets and they chase returns. As a result, they take more risks and are soon outside their risk-tolerance comfort zone. When the market turns, they panic and withdraw, often selling at a low. Then, when the dust settles, they want to buy back in. After suffering from analysis paralysis, they typically re-enter after the market has recovered, creating a highly unprofitable sell-low/buy-high cycle for themselves.</p>
                <h2>Diversification is Key to Protecting Yourself</h2>
                <p>The key is to diversify your investment portfolio in a manner that fits your personal investment style, your risk-tolerance level, your long-term goals &#8211; and then stick with it.</p>
                <p>A diversified investment strategy is not a cure-all; you will still experience losses if the market drops significantly. Why? Because there are two main types of risk, often referred to as systematic and unsystematic risk. Systematic risk, or market risk, is caused by events that are not specific to a particular company, industry or asset class. You cannot create a diversified portfolio that is immune to this risk. </p>
                <p>On the other hand, a diversified portfolio will give you a level of protection from unsystematic risk, which is associated with specific stocks, industries or asset classes. For example, a well-diversified portfolio might include a strategic mix of stocks across different industries, as well as across asset classes, such as bonds and/or commodities. The goal is to invest in assets that react differently during specific market events. For example, if the stock market crashes, bonds often increase in value.</p>
                <p>Remember, however, that investment risk can never be completely offset. Sometimes, investors with well-diversified portfolios mistakenly believe that they will be immune to market losses, so when they experience loss, it can cause unnecessary panic. </p>
                <h2>The Importance of Risk Tolerance</h2>
                <p>If you fully assess your risk-tolerance and invest accordingly, you will be less prone to panic during volatile markets. Risk tolerance is very individualized, but you can calculate it by being honest with yourself about how much risk you are willing to withstand. What amount of loss makes your stomach churn? Stay well away from that amount—even if attractive returns tempt you to ignore your personal comfort levels. </p>
                <p>No one can predict the future, and this is just as applicable to financial markets as to life itself. Has the stock market reached its peak? Are we due for an historic crash? Regardless of what comes next, a well-diversified investment portfolio, an appropriate risk- level, and a solid long-term strategy will help mitigate emotion and keep market events in the proper context. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>After a strong start to the week, U.S. stocks fell sharply Thursday on the back of disappointing results from Walmart and Cisco. Terror attacks in Spain and ongoing turmoil in the White House likely exacerbated the fall. Foreign stocks fared better, driven primarily by a strong week from emerging markets. Bonds were flat and gold was slightly down. </p>
                <p><strong>Weekly Returns:</strong><br />
                S&#038;P 500: 2,425 (-0.6%)<br />
                FTSE All-World ex-US: (+0.5%)<br />
                US 10 Year Treasury Yield: 2.19% (+0.00%)<br />
                Gold: $1,285 (-0.3%)<br />
                EUR/USD: $1.176 (-0.5%)</p>
                <p><strong>Major Events:</strong>    </p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Tuesday</strong> – North Korea officially backed down from its threats to launch a missile strike at Guam.</li>
                <li><strong>Wednesday</strong> – The U.S. Federal Reserve released its most recent minutes, showing a growing split on the timing of the next rate increase due to weak inflation readings.</li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – Industry bellwethers Walmart and Cisco reported weaker-than-expected quarterly results. </li>
                <li><strong>Thursday</strong> – A terror attack in Spain took the lives of at least 13 people.</li>
                <li><strong>Friday</strong> – Steve Bannon stepped down from his position as President Trump’s chief strategist in the White House. </li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Takeaway:</h2>
                <p>Thursday’s domestic selloff was mostly attributed to a string of disappointing earnings results from the likes of Walmart and Cisco. Of course other factors were at play, but the sharpness of the selloff seemed a bit unwarranted. After all, it was just a couple of misses in what has been a very strong quarter of positive earnings surprises. And this seems to be a trend of late. A recent report from Goldman Sachs showed companies reporting negative earnings surprises are being punished more severely than those being positively rewarded for beating expectations. </p>
                <p>Does this mean the market’s upside potential is limited or, worse yet, that a recession is near? Not at all. It’s mostly a reflection of investors’ skittishness as the market reaches new highs and valuations sit above historical norms. This is healthy behavior. We’d be more concerned if investors were piling into equities on mediocre, or even weak earnings results. Of course an eventual broader market correction is possible, but this has been the case for some time now. No one can really predict these since they’re unannounced, and the market often recovers almost as fast as it falls. Investors who try to avoid them just end up getting hurt in the long run. </p>
                <p>At the end of the day we need to put these little selloffs in perspective. The fact remains that global economic conditions are positive. U.S. corporate earnings have been strong and the employment situation continues to be a bright spot. Growth in Europe is also gaining momentum. As such, we don’t see anything suggesting this selloff is the beginning of something more sinister. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you could purchase a product that promised to give you a steady income for life and take the worry out of outliving your assets, would you jump at the chance? While it sounds like an easy decision, this type of product, called an annuity, may not be appropriate for everyone.</p>
                <h2>What is an annuity?</h2>
                <p>An annuity is an insurance contract that is typically used to provide a guaranteed income for life. In the world of personal finance, however, “guarantees” usually carry hefty price tags, and annuities are no exception. You should fully understand the pros and cons of these products before you decide <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/financial-planning-2/personal-capital-tax-series-5-annuity-right/" target="_blank">whether an annuity is right for your investment portfolio</a>. Additionally, these products are most often sold by a broker who receives a hefty commission for selling these products. Before you buy, it may be in your best interest to <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/wealth-management" target="_blank">consult a fiduciary financial advisor</a> before purchasing an annuity.</p>
                <h2>What types of annuities are there?</h2>
                <p>There are two basic types of annuities – immediate and deferred.</p>
                <ol>
                <li><strong>Immediate annuity</strong> – If you need a guaranteed stream of income right away, you can convert a lump sum to an immediate annuity that pays out monthly, quarterly or annually.</li>
                <li><strong>Deferred annuity</strong> – If you are years away from your retirement and want to make sure you have a fixed income coming in every month in your retirement, you can get a deferred annuity. You invest tax deferred money in the annuity to receive payments at a later date. Until you are ready to start receiving the payments your money will grow tax free like your 401k.</li>
                </ol>
                <p>Each of these annuities can have multiple options – single premium, flexible premium, fixed annuity, variable annuity, life income annuity, joint annuity, and equity-indexed annuity, to name a few.</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Single premium</strong> – You buy an annuity using a lump sum.</li>
                <li><strong>Flexible premium</strong> – You pay multiple premiums to the company.</li>
                <li><strong>Fixed</strong> – Your money will earn a fixed interest rate set by the insurance company. When you begin receiving income, a fixed payment is guaranteed.</li>
                <li><strong>Variable</strong> – Your money will be split into sub-accounts depending on your risk level, and be invested in mutual funds.  The annuity may pay a guaranteed minimum income based on the annuity value and performance, but the downside is it has substantially higher fees than traditional investment vehicles.</li>
                <li><strong>Equity-Indexed</strong> – A variation of a fixed annuity where the interest rate is based on an outside index, such as a stock market index. Like variable annuity this product pays a minimum rate which might go up if the index performs better.</li>
                <li><strong>Life income</strong> – You receive income as long as you live &#8211; even if payments exceed the amount of money you put into the annuity. If you buy an installment refund rider your beneficiaries will continue to receive payments even after you die until the total amount paid to you and your beneficiaries equals the premium. If you didn’t buy any rider, the insurance company will keep the money.</li>
                <li><strong>Joint-life income</strong> – This policy is typically purchased by couples, and payments are organized in a similar manner as life-only, except payments will continue until either you or your spouse pass away. Although you will get a lower monthly income than if you purchased a life-only option, the joint-life annuity option ensures that income will continue for the surviving spouse.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>What are the advantages and the disadvantages?</h2>
                <p><strong>Advantages</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Peace of mind that you won’t outlive your retirement assets</li>
                <li>With a variable annuity you can take risks (via the underlying investment options) and still have control of the outcome (via the option of guaranteed minimum income)</li>
                <li>Deferred annuity earnings are tax deferred – which can add a good chunk of money to your nest egg</li>
                <li>There is no yearly contribution limit for a non-qualified annuity meaning you can store away large amounts of cash and defer paying taxes. So, to put it in context, in the realm of tax-deferred vehicles such as an IRA or a 401k, there is a limit to what you can contribute. Whereas in an annuity, you can put in as much money as you want</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Disadvantages</strong></p>
                <ul>
                <li>Annuities can be expensive in terms of the benefits they provide. Below is a laundry list of costs that come with annuities</li>
                <ul>
                <li>Annual contract fee: Either fixed dollar amount or an expense ratio; for high value annuities, this fee may be waived</li>
                <li>Investment management fees</li>
                <li>Optional rider fees</li>
                <li>Commissions</li>
                <li>Withdrawal or surrender charges</li>
                </ul>
                <li>You already own an income annuity – it’s called Social Security</li>
                <li>Reduced liquidity</li>
                <li>Annuity earnings when you start drawing the payments are taxed as ordinary income</li>
                <li>Lack of transparency – annuities are very complex insurance products</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Our Takeaway: Before You Buy an Annuity</h2>
                <p>It’s important to keep in mind that by buying an annuity, you are signing a contract with an insurance company to make payments for a set period of time or for your lifetime. Not to mention, any type of “guarantee” comes at a high cost and not everyone will need one. On top of that there are so many different varieties of annuities with hundreds of options, riders, disclaimers, footnotes and contingencies, making them extremely complex. Locking your money up for a long time will take away flexibility and it’s important to think through what your true needs are.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>If you find that <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/blog/whitepapers/term-vs-permanent-life-insurance/" target="_blank">permanent life insurance</a> is a good product for you in context of your financial planning needs, there are many different types to choose from. Two of the most common types of permanent insurance are whole life and universal life insurance.</p>
                <p>Generally speaking:</p>
                <ul>
                <li><strong>Whole life insurance</strong> offers steady premiums and opportunity for cash value accrual through the investment component.</li>
                <li><strong>Universal life insurance</strong> offers flexibility by allowing you to make premium payments at any time and in any amount.</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>Whole Life Insurance</h2>
                <p>As the name states, whole life insurance covers you for your whole life. While premiums will be more expensive than what you will generally find in the term alternative, the premiums do something else for you – they build over time. This will result, if left untouched, in a cash value that will add to the final value of the policy. Unlike some universal life policies which allow for limited equity investing, with whole life policies, these excess premiums are not invested in the stock market, but rather are invested at the insurance company provider’s discretion. This does mean that you will likely be hampered in regards to the return you will enjoy through a whole life policy, but you also get the benefit of having level terms for your life – assuming you hold the policy until passing. </p>
                <p>In a traditional whole life insurance policy, your scheduled premium payments remain level and the costs are generally the same each year you’re alive. Some whole life policies, however, offer a modified payment schedule. With this payment option, the required premium payments start lower when you’re younger, then increase to higher amounts where they will then level out for the remainder of your policy. Just be sure to read over your policy to determine the amount of your premium payments and the schedule in which they are required to be paid as they vary from policy to policy. </p>
                <p>Whole life insurance is convenient if you need to access the cash generated by your policy in the event of a financial emergency. This loan is accessible without having to pay any taxes since policy loans are treated as debt. However, failure to pay back the loan will affect the overall cash value on the policy in the event of a death (the loan would be paid back via your death benefit proceeds).  </p>
                <h2>Universal Life Insurance</h2>
                <p>Universal life insurance is another type of permanent life insurance policy, similar to a whole life insurance policy in the sense you can build up a cash value. With universal life insurance, however, you can make premium payments at any time and in any amount, which offers some flexibility. A portion of the universal life insurance monthly premium is put into the cost of the policy and another portion is invested so it can be used toward investment savings. One benefit of universal life insurance is that it provides a life insurance policy and allows you to build savings at the same time. In some cases, the investment will grow over time and eventually may be able to pay for the premiums of the policy. On the other hand, if you stop making premium payments or withdraw the built-up cash value, it can affect your coverage amount. As a result, you may need to put more cash in or – in extreme cases – surrender the policy, which can trigger negative tax consequences.</p>
                <p>Generally, any excess premium payments you make can be allocated across separate accounts holding anything from stocks to bonds to mutual funds/annuities. Your investments though, are restricted by what your insurance company offers in terms of investment options for cash values, which vary widely from company to company. Make sure you find a company and policy that aligns with your investing preferences.</p>
                <h2>Modified Endowment Contracts (MECs)</h2>
                <p>If your permanent life insurance policy has too much cash value built up within it, either through extreme dividends accrued or through excessive deposits, it may be considered<br />
                a Modified Endowment Contract (MEC). This negatively affects the tax treatment of the<br />
                policy, particularly if withdrawals are taken before age 59 1⁄2. If you’re concerned about MEC considerations, please contact your financial advisor. </p>
                <h2>Our Takeaway</h2>
                <p>Whether you select whole or universal life insurance, permanent life insurance will provide you and your family with lifelong security. Your circumstances are unique to your own life, and you should speak with your advisor to determine what kind of life insurance is right for you. When you use our <a href="https://www.personalcapital.com/financial-software" target="_blank">free tools</a> to input your financial information, we can recommend a level of insurance coverage to help keep you and your family protected and on track for your long-term goals. </p>
